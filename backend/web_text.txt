Understanding Institutional Research
Institutional research (IR) helps institutions like SFBU to make decisions based on data. It involves identifying data, compiling it logically, and then analyzing it for the benefit of all department decision-makers, including those in admissions, academics, and marketing. The IR team works closely with other departments to improve the institution's practices.
Core Functions of the IR Department
The Institutional Research (IR) Department’s mission is to provide data and insight for the institution to assist the institution in achieving student academic success. Data is disseminated to all departments as well as the Board of Directors in order to drive informed decision-making.
In addition, the IR Department collects and reports data for its governing bodies and accrediting agencies.









Institutional Data
San Francisco Bay University utilizes the student entering cohort to track graduation rates. Graduation rates are based on the calendar year, and include all students in the cohort excluding student deaths or students called to active military service. Both the 100% on-time and 150% on-time completion is reflected at the undergraduate and graduate levels. For the undergraduate level, 100% on-time is equal to 4 years, and 150% on-time is equal to 6 years. For the graduate level, 100% on-time is equal to 2 years, and 150% on-time is equal to 3 years.










IPEDS
IPEDS is the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, a system of interrelated surveys conducted annually by the U.S. Department of Education’s National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). At this time, SFBU provide data to IPEDS on a voluntary basis as it does not participate in federal student aid programs. The IPEDS survey collects data on enrollments, program completions, graduation rates, faculty and staff, finances, institutional prices, and student financial aid, which is made available to students and parents through the College Navigator college search Web site and to researchers and others through the IPEDS Data Center.

Course Summary 
Cryptocurrency was created to remove the middle entity when people send/receive money and was designed for the “unbanked” people to gain access to the financial systems; there are almost a billion people who lack access to banking systems. In this course, you will learn the dynamics of Cryptocurrency including the leading crypto coins, Bitcoin and Ethereum. You will be studying the benefits and risks of using cryptocurrency. NFT (Non-Fungible Token) will be discussed as a concept and as a business vehicle. The course also illustrates how NFTs can be used to represent items such as photos, videos, audio, and other types of digital files as unique items, and use Blockchain technology to generate a verified proof of ownership. Another topic covered is DeFi (Decentralized finance) which is a Blockchain-based form of finance that does not rely on central financial entities like banks to offer traditional financial services, making it more secure. In addition, the course also explains Blockchain Technology and its applications. By the end of this course, students will have a good knowledge of Cryptocurrency, NFT, DeFi, and Blockchain Technology and the impact of such technologies on the future of finance and more.

Course Summary 
The term Metaverse is a hot topic of conversation recently, with many tech giants like Facebook and Microsoft staking claims. Author Neal Stephenson is credited with coining the term "metaverse" in his 1992 science fiction novel "Snow Crash," in which he envisioned lifelike avatars who live in realistic 3D buildings and other virtual reality environments. Since then, various developments have reached milestones on the way toward a real Metaverse: an online virtual world which incorporates augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), 3D holographic avatars, video, and other means of communication. As the Metaverse expands, it will offer a hyper-real alternative world or what comic fans call a parallel universe. After this course, you will be able to answer the question, “What is the Metaverse?” We will discuss the relationships between the Metaverse and blockchain, cryptocurrency, and NFTs. Real-life applications will be presented, and the future of the Metaverse will be explored.
No prerequisites or coding experience is required.

BSBA to GCM to MBA Program Pathway Sequence:
Through carefully planning, undergraduate SFBU students may enter the GCM program on their way to earning their MBA at SFBU. Without loss SFBU graduate level units accepted into the GCM program may in turn be counted by MBA student at the next level towards their MBA (core, major or electives), with the effect of making the GCM a stepping stone towards the MBA.
BSCS or BSBA students who took elective business courses earning MBA graduate level credits can transfer the MBA units, but engineering units are not transferable. For example, SFBU students may earn BSBA/BSCS, GCM and finally an MBA. Required GCM core and selectable courses do not need to be retaken and will be credited within the MBA program.
Joint MBA and GCM
Actively enrolled MBA students may request after paying the GCM graduation fee, a Graduate Certificate in Business Management certificate upon completing all GCM graduation requirements, even if they have not completed their MBA program.

Entrance Health Requirements 




 
Tuberculosis (TB) Testing Requirements for All Incoming Students
As an incoming student, you must have Tuberculosis (TB) testing before arriving on campus. The purpose is to keep the SFBU campus healthy and safe. You must visit your primary care physician (doctor) or a clinician before arriving at SFBU. Please print the following TB Risk Assessment and Clinical Tuberculosis Assessment by Health Care Provider (ACHA Adapted TB Screening Form):
TB Risk Assessment and Clinical Tuberculosis Assessment by Health Care Provider (ACHA Adapted TB Screening Form) 
The first part of the form, “Tuberculosis (TB) Risk Assessment,” must be filled out by your medical provider. If your doctor answers “Yes” to any of the questions, he/she must complete the second part of the form, “Clinical Tuberculosis Assessment by Health Care Provider.” Please upload the completed form to your Student Portal. Also, please upload copies of laboratory reports and chest x-rays, if any, with the completed form. If you don’t do this, your form will not be complete, and you will not be able to register for courses.
If you have questions, please see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) below. If you still have a question, please email health@sfbu.edu.
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Q1: What if my doctor will not fill out this form?
Please ask your doctor strongly to fill out this form, and explain that your university requires this form. At least, your doctor should provide his/her own TB test form, together with your medical records.


Q2: What if I had a TB test done recently?
You must complete another TB test if you have not had a TB test done in the month before the date of your acceptance to SFBU. If you have had a TB evaluation done in the last month, please send the testing report to health@sfbu.edu. SSFBU will review the report to decide if it is enough. Please do not send reports dated more than one month before the date of your acceptance letter.


Q3: What if I cannot schedule a doctor’s appointment in time before coming to SFBU?
You will have to get your TB evaluation immediately when you arrive. The TB evaluation takes one to two weeks to complete. You will not be able to register for courses until you complete your TB evaluation.


Q4: If I was born in the United States and never left the country, or if I am a permanent resident or U.S. citizen, do I still have to be tested?
Please have your doctor complete the “Tuberculosis (TB) Risk Assessment” form to decide if you need to be tested.

 
Meningococcal Facts
According to California Health and Safety Code Section 120397, you are being notified about the risks of meningococcal disease.
What you should know about meningococcal disease
It is a serious illness caused by bacteria that can infect the blood or areas around the brain and spinal cord. Infection can cause brain damage, disability, and quick death. Meningitis is the most common form of meningococcal disease. Common symptoms of meningitis include stiff neck, headache, and high fever.
Meningococcal vaccines can help prevent meningococcal disease. Check with your health care provider about meningococcal vaccines that you need.
How many people get the disease? Who is likely to get it?
Meningococcal disease is rare but serious. About 1,000 people in the U.S. get meningococcal disease each year. After babies, older adolescents (teens) and young adults have the highest rate of meningococcal disease. First-year college students living in dormitories are particularly at risk.
How serious is it?
About one in ten people who get meningococcal disease will die from it, even with treatment. Up to one in five people who survive will lose an arm or leg, become deaf, suffer brain damage, or have other problems.
How do Meningococcal Bacteria spread?
The bacteria are spread from person to person through air droplets. Close contact such as kissing, coughing, smoking, and living in crowded conditions (like dormitories) can increase the risk of getting the disease.
Overall, 5-10% of people in the U.S. have the meningococcal bacteria in their throat, but only a few of these people get sick. No one knows why some people get sick and others do not.
How can I protect myself?
You can protect yourself by:
	Not sharing items that have touched someone else’s mouth, such as cups, bottles, cigarettes, lip balm, and spoons and forks;
Not smoking; and
Getting vaccinated against meningococcal disease.

Check with your health care provider about which meningococcal vaccines you need.
Which Meningococcal Vaccines Should I Get?
MCV4 vaccine protects against four deadly types of meningitis. If you have not received this vaccine since your 16th birthday, get it now.
MenB vaccine protects against the most common cause of bacterial meningitis among teens and young adults. In recent years, Men B outbreaks have happened at University of California Santa Barbara, the University of Oregon, and Princeton University. Ask your doctor if you should get this vaccine.
For more information about meningococcal disease, please visit https://www.cdc.gov/meningitis/index.html

Refund Policy




Students who withdraw by the end of the first week of class in a period of attendance will receive a full refund. Following the first week of class and up through completion of 75 percent of the period of attendance, students may withdraw from SFBU and obtain a pro-rata refund of unearned institutional charges. The intent to report fee is non-refundable.
SFBU shall refund any credit balance on the student’s account within 45 days after the date of the student’s completion of, or withdrawal from, the student’s educational program.
A withdrawal may be effectuated preferably by the student’s written notice, as described above under cancellation, or by the student’s conduct, including, but not necessarily limited to, a student’s lack of attendance, as further detailed below.
A student is deemed to have been withdrawn when any of the following occurs: (1) the student drops all enrolled courses in a period of attendance, (2) the student submits a written notice to withdraw through the portal, as described in the cancellation section, (3) SFBU suspends or expels the student due to misconduct, unsatisfactory academic performance, or overdue fees, (4) SFBU terminates an F-1 student for violation of U.S Department of Homeland Security regulations, (5) the student fails to return from a leave of absence, or (6) the student, without prior approval, fails to attend four consecutive classes for all enrolled courses in a period of attendance.
 
A student that drops one or more courses, but not all courses, will receive a pro-rata refund of tuition for the dropped courses.
Calculation of Refund
Refund amount = total paid by student – amount owed
Amount Owed = (total institutional charge / hours in the program) X hours attended or scheduled to attend prior to withdrawal

Housing Scholarship 




Housing Scholarship

San Francisco Bay University grants a scholarship awarding free SFBU-owned housing (two consecutive trimesters) to approved qualified Presidential Scholarship recipients in the bachelor’s degree programs.

Minimum Eligibility for Consideration:
Standard admission requirements and satisfaction of minimum requirements of the Presidential Scholarship applicable to the program for which the applicant is applying; PLUS satisfaction of the following criteria:
	Minimum cumulative grade point average 3.50 on a 4.00 scale.
		Freshmen applicants (Bachelor’s): High school CGPA
Transfer applicants (Bachelor’s) (30 or more transferable units): College level CGPA

Minimum English proficiency score (for non-native English speakers) on any of the following:
		TOEFL - 80 (iBT)
TOEFL Essentials - 8.5 band
IELTS (Academic) - 6.5 band
PTE Academic - 64
iTEP Academic - 4.2
English proficiency requirement met based on the standard admissions requirements.


The housing scholarship may be limited in number, available on a first-come-first-serve basis, and is subject to continued availability of housing. Minimum eligibility does not guarantee a scholarship. The university reserves the right to deny an application for any reason.


Terms:
All terms applicable to the relevant Presidential Scholarship (Bachelor’s) apply. If a student with a Presidential Scholarship fails to adhere to its terms, the student’s Housing Scholarship will be rescinded.
Housing is limited and thus, the housing scholarship is contingent on the housing availability and a spot is not guaranteed until it is confirmed by the Housing department.
Once granted, the Housing Scholarship is only available for a period of two consecutive trimesters, beginning in the trimester during which a student commences the student’s course of study. In the event the student does not enroll in classes in any of the subsequent consecutive trimesters or takes a trimester break, the university shall have the right, but not the obligation, to extend the Housing Scholarship such that the student receives the scholarship for two full non-consecutive trimesters. The university’s right may be exercised in the university’s sole discretion.
A student granted a Housing Scholarship will be expected to share living facilities with other students and shall have no discretion as to who is housed with them. A student is not guaranteed his or her own room and, depending on the demand for housing, may be required to share a room with another student. The university reserves the right to assign roommates.
At the university’s sole discretion, a student who has been granted a Housing Scholarship may be moved and relocated to a different residence at any time, which may be of a different size, location, and arrangement from the student’s prior residence.
The scholarship is valid for housing payments only. The scholarship has no cash value. Any unused portion of housing payments will be forfeited.
While living in university housing, students must abide by all SFBU Housing Regulations, Rules and Policies. Failure in this regard may result in a loss of the Housing Scholarship and a forfeiture of housing eligibility.
The United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) generally treats scholarships in excess of the cost of tuition, such as scholarships for housing, as taxable income. Students receiving the Housing Scholarship are advised to discuss any potential tax implications with their tax professional. SFBU will comply with all IRS rules and regulations, including with respect to tax withholding and end-of-year tax reporting.

Housing Scholarship 





Housing Scholarship

San Francisco Bay University grants a scholarship awarding free SFBU-owned housing (two consecutive trimesters) to approved qualified Presidential Scholarship recipients in the master’s degree programs.

Minimum Eligibility for Consideration:
Standard admission requirements and satisfaction of minimum requirements of the Presidential Scholarship applicable to the program for which the applicant is applying; PLUS satisfaction of the following criteria:
	Minimum cumulative grade point average 3.70 on a 4.00 scale.
		CGPA from all completed undergraduate and graduate degrees.

Minimum English proficiency score (for non-native English speakers) on any of the following:
		TOEFL - 80 (iBT)
TOEFL Essentials - 8.5 band
IELTS (Academic) - 6.5 band
PTE Academic - 64
iTEP Academic - 4.2
English proficiency requirement met based on the standard admissions requirements.


The housing scholarship may be limited in number, available on a first-come-first-serve basis, and is subject to the continued availability of housing. Minimum eligibility does not guarantee a scholarship. The university reserves the right to deny an application for any reason.


Terms:
All terms applicable to the relevant Presidential Scholarship (Master’s) apply. If a student with a Presidential Scholarship fails to adhere to its terms, the student’s Housing Scholarship will be rescinded.
Housing is limited, and thus, the housing scholarship is contingent on housing availability, and a spot is not guaranteed until it is confirmed by the Housing department.
Once granted, the Housing Scholarship is only available for a period of two consecutive trimesters, beginning in the trimester during which a student commences the student’s course of study. In the event the student does not enroll in classes in any of the subsequent consecutive trimesters or takes a trimester break, the university shall have the right, but not the obligation, to extend the Housing Scholarship such that the student receives the scholarship for two full non-consecutive trimesters. The university’s right may be exercised in the university’s sole discretion.
A student granted a Housing Scholarship will be expected to share living facilities with other students and shall have no discretion as to who is housed with them. A student is not guaranteed his or her own room and, depending on the demand for housing, may be required to share a room with another student. The university reserves the right to assign roommates.
At the university’s sole discretion, a student who has been granted a Housing Scholarship may be moved and relocated to a different residence at any time, which may be of a different size, location, and arrangement from the student’s prior residence.
The scholarship is valid for housing payments only. The scholarship has no cash value. Any unused portion of housing payments will be forfeited.
While living in university housing, students must abide by all SFBU Housing Regulations, Rules and Policies. Failure in this regard may result in a loss of the Housing Scholarship and a forfeiture of housing eligibility.
The United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) generally treats scholarships in excess of the cost of tuition, such as scholarships for housing, as taxable income. Students receiving the Housing Scholarship are advised to discuss any potential tax implications with their tax professional. SFBU will comply with all IRS rules and regulations, including with respect to tax withholding and end-of-year tax reporting.

Student Health Insurance




All students must have health insurance while studying at SFBU, both when enrolled in courses and during any breaks. SFBU offers a student health insurance plan at reasonable rates. The cost of insurance appears on the “Tuition and Fees” slide of the Registration Procedures document on Schedule of Class page and also on the IEP Tuition and Fees page.
Health Insurance Coverage Period
Health insurance coverage is divided into three periods: Spring (January 1 - April 30); Summer (May 1 -August 31); and Fall (September 1 - December 31). If a student buys health insurance on or before the 30th day of the coverage period, his or her coverage starts from the beginning of the period. If a student buys health insurance after the 30th day of the coverage period, his or her coverage starts on the date of purchase.
For example, students who buy health insurance on January 30 for the Spring coverage period are covered for the entire Spring coverage period, so any problems which started between January 1 and January 29 are covered. However, students who buy health insurance on February 1 are covered only for the period from February 1 through April 30.
Current SFBU Students
If you have other valid U.S. health insurance, and you do not want to purchase health insurance through SFBU, your insurance plan documents must be uploaded to your portal before you register for courses.
Incoming New Students
If you have other valid U.S. health insurance, and you do not want to purchase health insurance through SFBU, your insurance plan documents may be uploaded to your portal before or after you register for courses.
About the Insurance Plan
The SFBU student Health insurance plan is offered by Global Benefits Group (GBG). The plan includes large networks of doctors and pharmacies, and focuses on easy use for all members. When you visit a participating health care provider or pharmacy, show your ID card, and they will file all claim forms for you.
Please refer to the SFBU Student Health Policy for more information.
Enrolled students can find a complete list of health care providers by visiting the provider directory. To access the provider directory, you must select “United States” in the drop-down menu.
You must pay a $20 copay for in-network doctor visits at the time of the visit. For medicine prescriptions, you must pay a $30 copay for generic drugs (Tier 1), a $60 copay for preferred brand-name drugs (Tier 2), and a $100 copay for non-preferred brand-name drugs (Tier 3). The SFBU Student Health Insurance Plan brochure has more information about copays.
To visit the insurer home page and create an account, go to www.gbg.com and select “member login.” Through this account, you will be able to file a new claim online or check the status of an existing claim.
Important Note: All SFBU new students must review the Health Requirements information.

Transfer Credit Policy




 

Transfer of Credit from Other Institutions



Undergraduate Transfer Credit 



Course credit earned at other institutions of higher education may be transferable. Credit transfer is made by the admission evaluators while conducting the admission evaluation. The transfer of credit is done at the program-of-study level, topic area level, the major and major selectable levels and on a case-by-case basis. The following statements apply to all transfer credits:
The SFBU Admissions Office must receive all official transcripts prior to the student’s joining a degree program. Without preapproval, transcripts received after the student joins SFBU cannot be used in transferring credits, except for records from the term immediately preceding the student’s starting trimester at SFBU. Up to 75 units of courses that have been reviewed and currently approved as part of a formal SFBU articulation/transfer agreement are guaranteed to transfer.
The student was officially enrolled in the course.
Courses eligible for transfer by prearranged transfer/articulation agreement shall follow the details contained in the agreement. Courses eligible for one-to-one matching course transfer will be evaluated based on the comparability in content, quality, and rigor with SFBU’s courses. Required courses require a closer comparability match. Courses eligible for topic area transfer may be mapped to the program's relevant topic area unit requirements without the need for one-to-one course matching and may have their units used to lieu of required units with the approval of the Registrar and School Dean. The transfer evaluation will include but is not limited to, course descriptions, course syllabi, and/or general public information. Students may be asked to provide course catalogs or syllabi if needed. Up to 75 units of courses that have been reviewed and currently approved as part of a formal SFBU articulation/transfer agreement are guaranteed to transfer.
When evaluating any foreign transcript, the admission evaluators may accept or transfer credit based on their knowledge of the course contents in comparison with similar courses offered in the U.S.
Without prior approval courses for transfer to SFBU may not be completed concurrently at another institution while a student is matriculated in an SFBU degree program.
College English courses taken at an institution where English is not an official language cannot be transferred for general education credit.
The credits under consideration for transfer must be earned at (1) institutions approved by the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education, (2) public or private institutions of higher learning accredited by an accrediting association recognized by the U. S. Department of Education, or (3) foreign institutions of higher learning. Credits earned at a foreign institution degree must be evaluated by a member of National Association of Credential Evaluation Services (NACES), Association of International Credential Evaluators (AICE), or American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO)’s International Education Services.
Professional Development Units (PDUs) offered by professional/industry organizations cannot be transferred to SFBU for academic credit.
Continuing Education Units (CEUs) offered on a non-academic basis by other academic institutions cannot be transferred to SFBU for academic credit.
The total credits transferred from other institutions to meet the student’s undergraduate program requirements are limited to 75 trimester units. Students must take at least 45 units at SFBU.
Credits transferred at the time of admission evaluation will reduce program length. Credit transferred from any outside institution has no effect on the calculation of the student’s GPA or CGPA.
Credits transferred from any outside institution are excluded from the maximum attempted units for the program.
Credits are transferred by the following conversion:
Definition of a Trimester Unit:
One trimester credit hour equals, at a minimum, 15 contact classroom hours of lecture, 30 contact hours of laboratory, or 45 contact hours of practicum.

Conversion Factor:
1 quarter unit = 0.66 trimester unit

Grades Required for Transfer Credit
In the bachelor's degree programs, applicable courses completed with an equivalency of a letter grade of "C" or better are transferable. ​Courses completed with Pass/No Pass are not transferable unless the transcript states that the general grading policy is not based on letter grades. This policy must be in writing from the institution (transcript key or a letter of verification).
Other Types of Undergraduate Transfer Credit
The following other types of credit may be transferable:
AP/IB course credit earned which is considered to be equivalent to college credit.
Credit by Examination - CLEP
SFBU grants credit to those students who pass examinations in English, natural sciences, humanities, and social science subjects offered by the College Level Examination Program (CLEP). Only General Education credits will be granted. Students should consult with the Admissions Office for information on acceptable CLEP scores and units. The CLEP Institution Code for SFBU is 7569.

Transfer of Credit from Defense Activity for Nontraditional Education Support (DANTES) and Military Services
Credits will be allowed for DANTES Subject Standardized Tests and professional military education evaluated by the American Council on Education (ACE). The maximum transferable credits follow the same policies as specified above. SFBU’s evaluation of an application is made prior to the student’s admission to a program unless otherwise approved by the authorizing VA office. The DANTES Institution Code for SFBU is 9670.

 

Graduate Transfer Credit 



Graduate course credit earned at other accredited higher education institutions may be transferable to meet the student’s graduation requirements if the courses are closely related to student’s intended program of study and the grade earned meets the requirement stated below. Such course credits are considered qualified transfer credits. Credit transfer is made by the admission evaluators while conducting the admission evaluation.
The following statements apply to qualified transfer credits:
The SFBU Admissions Office must receive all official transcripts prior to the student’s joining a degree program. Without preapproval, transcripts received after the student joins SFBU cannot be used in transferring credits, except for records from the term immediately preceding the student’s starting trimester at SFBU. Up to 12 units of courses that have been reviewed and currently approved as part of a formal SFBU articulation/transfer agreement are guaranteed to transfer.
The student was officially enrolled in the course.
Courses eligible for transfer will be evaluated based on the comparability in content, quality and rigor of SFBU’s courses. The transfer evaluation will include, but is not limited to, course descriptions, course syllabi, and/or general public information. Students may be asked to provide course catalogs or syllabi if needed. Up to 12 units of courses that have been reviewed and currently approved as part of a formal SFBU articulation/transfer agreement are guaranteed to transfer.
No more than 12 units of qualified graduate-level course credits may be transferred. Students must take at least 24 units at SFBU degree program.
Without prior approval, courses for transfer to SFBU may not be completed concurrently at another institution while a student is matriculated in an SFBU.
The credits contemplated for transfer must be earned at (1) institutions approved by the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education, (2) public or private institutions of higher learning accredited by an accrediting association recognized by the U. S. Department of Education, or (3) foreign institutions of higher learning. Credits earned at a foreign institution degree must be evaluated by a member of National Association of Credential Evaluation Services (NACES), Association of International Credential Evaluators (AICE), or American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO)’s International Education Services.
Professional Development Units (PDUs) offered by professional/industry organizations cannot be transferred to SFBU for academic credit.
Continuing Education Units (CEUs) offered on a non-academic basis by other academic institutions cannot be transferred to SFBU for academic credit.
Credits transferred, performed at the time of admission evaluation will reduce program length. Credit transferred from any outside institution has no effect on the calculation of the student’s GPA or CGPA.
Credits transferred from any outside institution are excluded from the maximum attempted units for the program.
Credits are transferred by the following conversion:
Definition of a Trimester Unit:
One trimester credit hour equals, at a minimum, 15 contact classroom hours of lecture, 30 contact hours of laboratory, or 45 contact hours of practicum.

Conversion Factor:
1 quarter unit = 0.66 trimester unit

Grades Required for Transfer Credit
In the master’s degree programs, qualified courses completed with an equivalency of a letter grade of "B" or better are transferable.

  Silicon Valley’s Top Companies Surround our Bay Area University






San Francisco Bay University's new campus sits amidst the apex of innovation. Silicon Valley sets the tone for the rest of the globe in high technology and design. We are proud to graduate students in computer science and engineering that go on to build lucrative careers for themselves, either here in the U.S.A. or in other countries. The fact is we are located in a pretty magical location. What makes it so great?
According to the Brookings Institution, while the tech sector is lifting the economy as a whole, most of those job benefits are concentrated in just a few places, and one of those is here. Their report notes that 90% of all innovation sector employment growth in the past 15 years has taken place in Seattle, Boston, San Francisco, San Diego, and San Jose, California. This should be a surprise to no one. That’s why at San Francisco Bay University, we pride ourselves on our location - as a high-tech university in the San Francisco Bay Area - amidst some of the biggest movers and shakers in the tech industry.
It is important to note that tech jobs are in high demand and represent the strongest growing occupational cohort. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment in computer and information technology occupations is expected to grow by 13% from 2020 to 2030. This represents a faster growth rate than the average for all other occupations. The fact is this: Jobs in the innovation sector are going to grow, year-after-year, for the foreseeable future.
But why the high demand? Because jobs in cloud computing, big data collection and storage, and information security seem to grow by the day. Technological advancements evolve faster and faster, and as our world changes, the industry needs professionals who understand advanced concepts and know how to operate advanced machinery and technologies. Even ancillary industries, such as computer systems design, management, and technical consulting services will all see big-time growth in the coming decade.
Why the Bay Area is a High-Tech Hub
There is no doubt about it. Silicon Valley has emerged as the destination of choice for startups and established tech companies. Even international tech companies have made big efforts to establish a foothold in the Bay Area. They know that Bay Area colleges and universities - much like SFBU - graduate students that are ready for future-proofed jobs. Being a university in Silicon Valley, we understand this imperative quite well.
Silicon Valley, which is located in the southern region of the San Francisco Bay Area of California, is widely known as a global center of technological design and innovation. There is a reason why Silicon Valley is named after the primary material in computer microprocessors. There is a wealth of technology, software, hardware, and internet companies here, of all sizes.
Silicon Valley is also one of the wealthiest regions in the world and certainly is one of the hottest real estate markets. In the end, much of the success of Silicon Valley can be attributed to the social and cultural aspects of the tech community that set up shop here.
But that’s not all:
Location-Specific Benefits: Similar markets and industries tend to concentrate in particular areas. Dedicated marketplaces and malls exist for a reason. Competitors lining up close to each other does not happen by chance. Not only do people prefer a variety of choices, but it is easy to build infrastructure and similar businesses where others have already done so.
Networking and Specialization: Silicon Valley is consistently characterized by innovation, collaboration, and risk-taking. And since everyone is here, it is easy to connect with experienced and supportive mentors and other individuals in a particular industry or field of study. Finance companies go to Wall Street and tech companies go to Silicon Valley.
Local Opportunities: The timely availability of information and insights through a local network is vital for startups and established businesses alike. Here in Silicon Valley, the free flow of information provides itself as a one-stop-shop with seminars, product fairs, meetups, events, and workshops. This is where people rub elbows and learn the latest and greatest in technology and innovation.
With so many reasons to establish a tech presence in Silicon Valley, it’s no surprise that some of the top tech companies in the world are right here.
The Who’s Who of Tech Companies
Right here near the campus of San Francisco Bay University are some of the world’s top tech companies. Students studying for their bachelor’s or master’s in computer science or electrical engineering are surrounded by the tech companies of their dreams. And for graduating students reading this, continue on, we’ve got some important links for you.
Amazon:  If you want to talk about a tech behemoth, you have to start with Amazon. Amazon has multiple locations in the Bay Area including Sunnyvale, Cupertino, Palo Alto, and San Francisco. Amazon’s Bay Area locations offer careers in Amazon Web Services, Amazon Game Studios, Amazon Lab126, Amazon Digital Music, Prime Now, and subsidiaries like Audible and Twitch.

  10 Job Interview Tips for SFBU Graduates






Well, you’ve graduated. You put in all that time, effort, and hard work to obtain a world-class degree from San Francisco Bay University. So, that’s it, right? The hard part is over and now it’s time to party! Wrong. Certainly, you should celebrate. Completing one of SFBU’s programs is no small task. Bask in the glory. But that doesn’t mean there is no more work left to do.
Now, it’s time to put that degree to good use and land yourself a job - and build a career - that you love. But how do you do that? How do you apply the skills you’ve learned to get a job in your field of study? And how do you stand out in a crowd of recent college graduates? Don’t worry, that’s where we come in.
Fortunately, all it takes is a little preparation. From researching the company to practicing your interview skills and following up after the interview - each of these steps will get you a little closer to “You’re hired!” So, without further delay, let’s dig into each of our top interview tips, plus a couple extra for good measure!
1. Research the Position and Company You’re Interviewing For
Even though companies across the country face a worker shortage, that doesn’t mean landing an interview and getting the job is a cake-walk. Employers notice when you attend a college or university in Northern California because the California university system is held in high regard. And if you apply for a job in California, you will be competing with students who’ve all had a stellar education. It is vital that you stand out and prove to your potential employer that you’ve done your homework and deserve the job more than all those other people.
Researching the company before you actually go to the interview shows initiative. It allows you to talk more knowledgeably about why you think you are a good fit for the company. It also demonstrates your interest and enthusiasm for the job. And finally, it shows a high level of professionalism and diligence. Consider researching the following about your prospective employer:
Products
Services
Mission Statement
History
Culture
Now that you’ve done your research, it’s time to prepare yourself for the questions that are sure to come.
2. Prepare Thoughtful Answers to Common Questions
Regardless of where you interview, it is highly likely you will get this question: “Why do you want to work here?” While this question may seem benign, the interviewer is asking it for a specific reason. They want to know how much time you took to research the company! We’ve covered the research options above, now you have to prepare your answers.
As you answer questions, ensure you mention the aspects of the company that appeal to you and align with your career goals. Does the company donate to causes you support? Do they offer benefits you find particularly appealing? These are appropriate points of common interest. Feel free to use them as you demonstrate your knowledge of the company.
3. Prepare Intelligent Questions to Ask Your Interviewer
A job interview is a two way street. Not only is it about finding out if you are a good fit for the company; it’s also about if they are a good fit for you. Your questions go a long way in determining this. And knowing what questions to ask demonstrates just as much initiative as asking the right questions. If you end up sitting there only talking when talked to, it’s highly unlikely you’ll get a call back.
A good rule of thumb is to prepare at least two questions to ask your interviewer, and more if you feel comfortable. Memorize them if you can. You want to ask questions specific to the company, but also consider the following generic options:
What would a typical day in the position look like?
How would you describe the company culture?
What are your biggest challenges/opportunities at the moment?
What is your favorite/least favorite thing about working here?
How do you measure performance/success?
Also, consider creating a one-minute “elevator pitch” to explain your experience. Be simple and concise. You don’t want to come off as arrogant or long-winded.
So, you’ve done your research and figured out appropriate questions. What’s next? It’s time to practice, practice, practice!
4. Practice With a Friend
You can prepare all you want, but if you don’t apply your preparation to real-world practice, you’ll never become an expert. You won’t be ready. Deliberately practicing what you have prepared has several beneficial effects. Not only do you get better at doing what you practice, but you increase the odds of success (“You’re hired!”) when it matters most. You’ll also start to replace old habits with new habits. Research shows the power of habits and how to change, modify, or develop them.
Practicing with a friend also provides you with the ability to correct mistakes. The last thing you want to do is slip up while you’re in the interview. Be sure to give your practicing partner the green light to be critical, provide honest advice, and give tips and pointers where applicable. You don’t want them to be afraid to critique you. Once you feel ready, it’s time to take a deep breath and head to the interview! Let’s talk about the impression you want to make.
5. Dress Professionally, Be Clean, and Well-Groomed
The power of practice is not the only one proven (say that five times fast!). There is also a lot of power in the first impression. There is plenty of research to prove first impressions are long-lasting. How you dress and groom yourself is absolutely a part of your overall evaluation for the job. Dress professionally, practice good hygiene, cut your hair, and look your best. This is the time to do it.
Today, we live in the age of Zoom, so you may end up doing interviews remotely. That doesn’t mean, however, that it should be business up top and casual on the bottom. When you dress professionally from head to toe, it helps you get into the right mindset. Don’t short change how you look simply because you are not physically in the room with your interviewer.
6. Bring a Resume, Notebook, Pen, and Business Cards
Being prepared for the interview goes beyond questions and answers. Make sure you show up with the tools you need to follow along, take notes, ask follow up questions, and leave your contact info. No matter how much you prepare, it is likely you will need to write something down. Doing so also shows initiative. It proves to your interviewer that you come ready, no matter the situation.
If you are concerned about walking into your interview with an armful of items, consider a thin laptop bag or portfolio. This way you can organize your things and add a bit of flash and pizzazz to your first impression.
7. Arrive 10 to 15 Minutes Early
There’s a saying: Being early is arriving on time. And when it comes to job interviews, it is absolutely true. Arriving early isn’t only about impressing your interviewer. It’s also about allowing yourself some time to de-stress, take a deep breath, and collect your thoughts. You’ll have time to go over your questions again and prepare your answers.
Consider the journey as well. In today’s society, it is a little too easy to rely on your smartphone to get around. But phones run out of power and GPS signals and maps aren’t always reliable. After the experience of attending a university in San Francisco or the surrounding area, you are well aware of how congested the traffic can be. Plan your journey, mark your directions, and leave extra early to account for the unexpected. And if you do rely on an app, consider Waze, as it will alert you to unexpected events that other map apps might miss.
8. Turn Off Your Cell Phone
This may seem obvious, but far too many people make the mistake of not silencing their phone during an interview. Sure, you may not get passed over simply because it accidentally rings, but your interviewer is evaluating every aspect of the interview. Not silencing your cell phone shows a lack of preparation and will reflect as a ding against you.
Turning your cell phone off also prevents distractions. With the tons of notifications we all get on our phones all day long, the last thing you need is noises or vibrations of all types causing you to forget one of your important questions. Also, avoid checking your phone during the interview. Nothing says “I couldn’t care less” more than when you look at your phone while you are interacting with someone, interview or no.
9. Treat Every Person You Meet Politely and With Respect
Being polite and respectful is important not just because it might get you a job, but because it is the right thing to do. It also demonstrates professionalism and the ability to get along with people, which are both pretty important when it comes to working with others.
Consider that you are probably being evaluated not just on how you treat your interviewer, but also on how you treat the receptionist or other office workers. If you are nice to your interviewer but rude to everyone else, don’t expect to get the job. Demonstrate a sunny demeanor, smile a lot, and be gracious. Consider this advice not just for a job interview, but for life.
10. Be Confident and Make Eye Contact During Your Interview
You don’t want to have a disconnect between what you say and how you act. You can have all the best answers and ask all the right questions, but if you aren’t confident, your interviewer will see that. Sit up straight, don’t mumble, and make eye contact with your interviewer.
There is a fine line between confidence and arrogance. Both stem from one’s belief in oneself, but arrogance is a result of an exaggerated sense of self. Sure, you just graduated from the best university in San Francisco and the Bay Area, but don’t make that the sole focus of your interview. Don’t spend the entire time talking about your accomplishments, but when you do, tie them back into how they will enhance your ability to do the job you’re applying for.
Your Two Bonus Tips
Wow! That was fun, right? Well, we aren’t done yet. We’ve got a couple bonus tips for you to ensure you ace your post-SFBU interview. These final tips will be the cherry on top of your successful job interview.
First, consider using the S.T.A.R. method as you answer questions and interact with your interviewer. The acronym stands for:
Situation: A situation you had to deal with.
Task: The task you were given to do.
Action: The action you took.
Result: What happened as a result and what you learned from the experience.
If you have problems coming up with ways to explain your accomplishments, the S.T.A.R. method may help. Indeed, many interviewers use the S.T.A.R. method themselves when evaluating what questions to ask, so if you use it in preparing answers, you are ahead of the game.
And finally, don’t forget to give thanks. Thank your interviewer for the opportunity to speak in person or over Zoom, then also thank them via email or a hand-written note. After all, you want to make sure your last impression is a good one.
Now that you’ve learned what you need to do, it’s time to apply it. Ace your next interview with SFBU’s top tips for a winning interview!

  SFBU’s Restaurant and Eateries Guide in Fremont, Silicon Valley, and Beyond!






As a Bay Area university, we understand how special our home is. San Francisco Bay University is situated where the apex of art, culture, technology, and cuisine come together. SFBU is proud to be part of such a thriving community. The culinary opportunities are ripe in the area around Fremont, California - an area filled with California universities and colleges, technology companies, and more. Imagine the possibilities not just for SFBU students, but for parents, friends, family, and other visitors. From hamburgers to Michelin Stars, we’ve got it all.
Still, what if you’re an SFBU student not necessarily looking for the next Michelin Star or three? Maybe you just want to eat somewhere good and close to campus. Time is of the essence in your studies. That’s why we wanted to balance our list not just with excellent culinary opportunities but also with places that are close to campus and easily accessible. Of course, we want to give our local businesses here in Fremont, California some love. But still, let’s take a small trip around San Francisco and the Bay Area.
Why is the San Francisco Bay Area a Culinary Capital?
People usually talk about New York and Los Angeles. Go to Paris they say. But there are currently 115 options on the Michelin Star San Francisco List. There is a LOT of good food in the Bay Area. San Francisco has become known as a culinary destination for good reason. Northern California is a beautiful destination and a perfect place to create culinary expressions of taste and presentation.
When you live in the San Francisco Bay Area, you know good food. The standard for fine dining excellence can be found right here. San Francisco restaurants are on the cutting edge of not just food preparation, but food design. The Bay Area is a place where gastronomy meets cuisine. Restaurants like Atelier Crenn set the standard for Bay Area innovation in dining and are still there creating delicious dishes for lucky diners. Other San Francisco legends perfect for a partner or visiting parents include Nopa and Ryoko’s.
Northern California is home to some of the country’s best wineries, the most fertile agricultural land, and the highest-quality seafood and meats. The restaurants with access to these treasures of land and sea create amazing things out of them. And it is they who have put San Francisco on the map as the cuisine capital of the country. Yet, there is more to San Francisco than Michelin Stars. Here, students attending colleges and universities in Fremont and the surrounding areas want to know where to eat. Maybe they don’t want to trek into town for a Michelin Star. Let’s get local.
A Bay Area University Beyond the Bay
We like to say “We are the bay.” But we are also a university beyond the Bay. And we mean that in a metaphorical sense. We are a part of the Bay Area, but we are in an area of our own. We are in Silicon Valley. There is an entirely different scene here and SFBU students can feel it. Whether seeking a U.S.-based education from another country or from the local area - attending university in Fremont is a different feeling.
And with that different feeling comes different culinary opportunities. When you talk about eating in Fremont, San Jose, or other areas, people wonder, what’s going on food-wise in the tech suburb? Well, quite a lot actually. Indeed, if San Jose has any distinguishing characteristic, it’s that it is, far and away, the Bay Area’s greatest immigrant food city.
Don’t let the tech-heavy narrative of the Silicon Valley area drown out the culinary identity of the place. Food hubs like the predominantly Mexican and Vietnamese enclaves of East San Jose came into being, in large part, because those neighborhoods were the only areas in San Jose where working-class immigrants and refugees could afford to live and open businesses.
It is also important to consider geographic proximity. Many of these small neighborhoods were so close together that a lot of the immigrant children who lived there went to school together, became friends, married, and intermingled their cuisine. This led to a vibrant fusion cuisine scene in the San Jose area, and it shows.
Top Tips for SFBU Students Looking for Eats in the Area
First, consider some of the Best of Fremont options in 2021! Although Fremont is part of the Silicon Valley area, we do have our own distinct flavor and lifestyle here. Each year the Best of Fremont list puts together some of the highlights of our hometown.
Otherwise, there are some quite decent places around the university students can choose from to get a quick, healthy, and tasty meal. We did an internal poll here of SFBU employees and admissions staff to figure out the places we like and would be happy to recommend to our students. Here’s where we would recommend if you want a good bite to eat in the area:
Paris Baguette: We found this to be a great option for someone seeking a sweet treat or a pastry on the go. They are a local bakery that tries to provide a personal feel. To them, pastries aren’t just a product, they are their passion. They have bakers, cakes, and baristas serving up freshly-baked loaves of bread, delicious coffee, and cakes more than worthy of SFBU students’ standards.
Sala Thai: This one was on more than a few internal lists. Not only is Sala Thai only a couple of blocks from the school, but it’s also one of the better Thai options in the area. Because Thai food isn’t hard to come by. It's great Thai food that stands out, and Sala Thai is pretty great. Students can eat in or order take-out and can expect fast service and affordable prices.
Chaat Bhavan: While we are going around the world with recommendations, we figured why not take students to India! Even better, Chaat Bhavan specializes in vegetarian food. For students who are a bit more discerning in terms of the meat they do or don’t eat, this option is just for them!
Fremont California is, of course, a vibrant city with lots of options. Students attending a Bay Area university here, whether SFBU or otherwise, have plenty of restaurants to choose from. Whether it be a delicious In-n-Out burger or a hot-fudge sundae from McDonald’s, all the options are right here!

  SFBU’s Favorite Bay Area Beaches






San Francisco Bay University is situated in an exceptional location: Fremont, California. After all, we are still the closest East Bay city to the high-tech Silicon Valley network of businesses, and as such we have access to a strong tech industry presence. We all know that those in the tech industry live by a common motto; they indeed work hard, with 30% of surveyed tech workers admitting they work between seven and ten hours per day, but they like to play hard too. And the same goes for SFBU students. As a San Francisco Area university, we have plenty of “play hard” options. As an East Bay university, we have access to restaurants and bars of all shapes and sizes. And yet, what if a little more relaxation time is what you seek?
Well, that’s where the beaches come in. Colleges and universities in San Francisco have access to some of the most beautiful beaches on the West Coast. Someone once said, “The West Coast is the Best Coast” and we couldn’t agree more. And yet, when you picture a typical California beach in your mind, you are likely to think of sun-drenched Southern California, from Santa Monica Pier to Dana Point. And yet, the beaches here in San Francisco have a charm all their own. San Francisco Area university students and locals from all over the area have a plethora of beautiful beaches to choose from. Which ones are your favorites? Here, we introduce you to what we consider to be three of the more notable beaches in the San Francisco Bay Area.
1. Montara State Beach
You might think we would start with one of the more busy and popular options, like Ocean Beach or Baker Beach, but we wanted to deliver some more insider information instead. Let’s visit some beaches students who aren’t from the local area may never have heard of. So, first, we’ll head a half hour’s drive outside of San Francisco to Montara State Beach, a lesser-known beach that boasts magnificent views of the Pacific Ocean. Make sure to bring your hiking shoes, however, as the path down to the beach can be a little gnarly. But due to its location and rugged entrance, it is one of the cleanest and most secluded beaches that San Francisco area university students have access to.
Even better, the waters around the beach are part of a protected marine recreation area. For those who like to plan ahead, visit sometime between March and June and you may be lucky enough to spot humpback whales as they begin moving closer to shore! Restaurants and grocery stores are located nearby in the towns of Montara and Moss Beach. Point Montara Lighthouse offers overnight accommodations and McNee Ranch encompasses a coastal mountain range with well-manicured trails and beautiful views of the Pacific Ocean.
2. Agate Beach Park
Located a short drive north of San Francisco proper near Bolinas, Agate Beach Park is definitely one for all you nature-loving SFBU students out there. This beach is a drone photographer’s dream, with turquoise blue and green waters surrounding picturesque rocky outcroppings. And with almost two miles of ocean shoreline and a 6.6-acre park, there is plenty to see and do. When the tide is low, beautiful tidepools appear ready for exploration.
Even better, tidepools aren’t the only beautiful things to explore at Agate Beach Park. Expect to see birdwatchers looking for up to 73 different bird species, from the ring neck pheasant to the sharp-tailed grouse. The secluded nature of Agate Beach Park also means you might even catch a glimpse of a sea lion or two sunning itself on one of the many rocky outcroppings dotting the shoreline.
3. Kiteboard Beach
After taking you away from our local area to some lesser-known beaches, we wanted to bring it home and introduce you to a beach for SFBU students who are looking for an adrenaline rush. Welcome to Kiteboard Beach. While Kiteboard Beach is approximately 18 miles away in San Mateo, for those looking for good wind and surf, Kiteboard Beach is an excellent option. We know there are plenty of San Francisco area university students out there who are avid thrill-seekers.
For those who want to test their skills, summer is the perfect time for kiting, whether on land or water, in Santa Cruz and San Francisco’s Bay Area. While Kiteboard Beach is the closest, there are excellent kiteboarding spots all up and down the coastline. But if you also want to just chill and enjoy the sounds of the surf, that is also an option. Just always be careful of the rough ocean currents and riptides that swirl around Kiteboard Beach.
We understand these beaches are a bit of a trek, but we wanted to introduce SFBU students to something more off the beaten path. But if you’re looking for something a little closer to home, here are some other top beaches in the Bay Area:
Ocean Beach
Baker Beach
China Beach
Davenport Beach
Mile Rock Beach
Marshall’s Beach
… and more!
The beauty of living in the San Francisco Bay Area is that we’ve got a lot to choose from. There’s no shortage of beautiful beaches for SFBU students to choose from. All you need to do is pick one, pack up, and head out. And speaking of packing up…
San Francisco Area University Students’ Beach Checklist
Before you make your way to one of these beautiful beaches, make sure to set a checklist for yourself. The last thing you want is to head to the beach unprepared. Here are some helpful tips to ensure you have a great time on the beach.
Find Shade: One of the first rules of beachgoing is to get there early so you can get a shady spot. Or you can bring a beach umbrella or shade tent. Whatever works to keep the sun’s rays from cooking you.
Bring a Mesh Bag: You may be tempted to bring a tote or dry bag for all your goodies, whether towels, speakers, flotation devices, or otherwise, but consider the humidity. Mesh bags prevent mold and allow for proper airflow.
Bring Bug Spray: For those visiting any of these beaches early in the morning, bug spray is a must. Whether it be mosquitoes, sand flies, beach hoppers, or other insects, swarms of them can cast a serious pall on your otherwise calm and serene beach day.
Follow the Rules: Remember that it is against the law to consume alcohol in California state parks. Also, make sure to pay attention to where lifeguards are and look for guidance if you are unsure of whether or not the water is safe.
Watch for Rip Tides: The one thing Southern California beaches have on their neighbors to the north is calmer waters. Beaches around the Bay Area tend to be rougher and a bit more dangerous, with more rip tides and strong currents.
We hope you’ve enjoyed this romp through some of the best and most notable beaches in the San Francisco Bay Area. Are you a student from out of state or overseas reading this and wishing you could be attaining a world-class education and lounging on some of Northern California’s most beautiful beaches? If so, contact our admissions office today!

  A Virtual Tour of the San Francisco Bay University Campus






Welcome to San Francisco Bay University! We are so proud to introduce you to our brand new campus, opened in January of 2022. Located in beautiful Fremont, California, our new campus reflects our status as one of the premier universities in San Francisco Metro. SFBU offers a remote learning environment for certain programs, but that does not mean we skimped on our in-person campus, which is beautiful, accommodating, and retrofitted for a 21st-century education.
Did you know that as of 2021, 54% of U.S.-based university students agreed or strongly agreed that their health and well-being were prioritized at the college or university they were attending? This may seem great, but that means almost half of the rest of the students surveyed said their health and well-being were not priorities. Here at SFBU, we are proud to provide a facility that comfortably falls within the 54% who feel like their health and well-being are prioritized, and our new campus reflects that.
Many of our campus improvements include hub-type areas that allow students to learn together in an accommodating and collaborative environment. After all, both professors and students want to have a comfortable place to learn, work, and have quality conversations about the programs they are in. But the question is: What are the specific improvements we have brought to our new, beautiful campus? Let’s take a deeper look into the new SFBU.
Learning Resource Center
Our new learning resource center is designed to provide students with a space to study, learn, and collaborate. SFBU’s learning resource center offers a self-learning environment, perfect for learning and mastery utilizing several different mediums, whether audio, visual, or otherwise. Information and computing technology have changed the way university learning centers operate, and ours is no exception. We draw upon the latest technologies to ensure our students have access to the information they need to become masters in their subjects.
New Computer Labs
As a university in California that offers programs in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, we want to make sure our students have high tech computer labs to utilize as they work on their programs. SFBU students can expect the latest high-speed computers, lightning fast fiber internet, and comfortable seats and desks. Even better, we provide multiple computer labs for students to use. That way, there is enough space for everyone who needs to use a computer to help them complete their studies.
Faculty Offices
Our faculty deserve only the best. Why? Because they provide the best education for SFBU students. Our fully renovated faculty offices provide everything our professors need to ensure our student body receives a first-class education. There is a reason we are one of the top-tier San Francisco universities, and this is reflected in our new faculty office design.
Cafe and Dining Hall
Students will have a hard time focusing on their studies if they are not well fed, hydrated, and enjoying access to a fully stocked cafe and dining area. We understand students attending California universities and colleges have a high expectation of the services they receive. That’s why here at SFBU, once COVID restrictions are lifted, we will proudly offer meal plans balanced with healthy proteins, vegetables, fruit, and starches. We will also have vending machines for quick eats and our dining areas have comfortable seating, bright lighting, and wide open spaces for students to get comfortable as they eat, talk, and collaborate. We’re looking forward to the lifting of COVID restrictions so SFBU students can safely enjoy the dining hall and cafe together!
Outdoor Quad
There is nothing like a little fresh air and sun after you’ve been studying hard inside our new campus. That’s why we designed our outdoor quad to provide a comfortable space for our students to relax in the warm San Francisco sun and air. It’s a comfortable green space with chairs, tables, and trees. It is the perfect space for students, faculty, and administrative staff alike to unwind after a long day of study and hard work.
Administrative Offices
Our fully redesigned administrative offices provide a perfect environment for our administrative staff. This is where our back-office personnel helps SFBU students get through the application process. Our administrative staff proudly helps students through their application process. Without them, From new desks and computers to wide open spaces, bright lighting and lots of windows, these are office spaces that administrative staff can be proud of!
Upgraded Classrooms
SFBU students attending class onsite can expect to learn in an environment that contains fixed and mobile seating, adequate lighting, plenty of space to move around, power outlets, and big boards that professors can use as they instruct the students. We’ve designed our classrooms with our student body in mind and we are convinced those that learn onsite will appreciate the effort we have put into our state-of-the-art classrooms.
New Lecture Hall
Students attending universities in the United States know that the lecture hall is a critical component of any learning environment. Here at SFBU, our new and improved lecture hall can be used not only for professorial lectures, but for special events, seminars, and workshops. With open stadium seating that can seat up to 70 people, and favorable acoustics, our new lecture hall will be perfect for students and professors alike. For pre- and post-event gatherings, the lecture hall opens into a large hallway perfect for long tables and areas for people to stand and mingle.
Quiet Study Area
San Francisco universities are full of the hustle and bustle of student activity. That’s why we wanted to make sure we provide SFBU students with a way to study in a quiet environment. Our quiet study area offers comfortable seating, soft lighting, and those who utilize it are encouraged to keep their talking and noise to a minimum. This is where SFBU students find a quiet place to study and gather their thoughts as they work on their SFBU programs.
Recreation and Student Lounge
Our recreation and student lounge is designed to provide students with a relaxing place to unwind, relax, and study. Whether you want to play foosball, kick back and relax, or have a meet-up with your fellow students, this is the perfect place to do it.
Here at SFBU, we have designed our spaces with students in mind. We have utilized a wide-open hub-style approach. This way, students have easy access to the space they need, whether it is the student lounge, dining hall, quiet study area. Our spaces are filled with light, high ceilings and windows to allow natural light in.
The San Francisco Bay University campus is located at 161 Mission Falls Lane in beautiful Fremont, California, 94539. Stop by and have a look at what makes our campus so special.

  We’re Proud to Be a University in Fremont California






It’s quite likely you’ve heard of San Francisco, but you might not have heard of Fremont. And yet, our hometown of Fremont, California is a hotbed of innovation, culture, networking, community, and opportunity. While it may not be the most well-known city, many of the companies and institutions that call Fremont home are very well-known. Take Tesla, as one example. Fremont was the site for Tesla’s first manufacturing facility. Over time, many articles have come out detailing the hard-working working nature of Californians. We’re proud to be a university in Fremont, California.
Is Fremont the Happiest City in California?
You heard it here; Fremont is the happiest city in California. After WalletHub surveyed America’s 182 biggest cities and Fremont, California came in first place! We’re not just the happiest city in California, we’re the happiest city in the nation! It’s pretty incredible really. And it’s why SFBU is happy to call this town home. These happiness factors measured income, employment, community, and environmental health.
Here's an interesting tidbit from the survey. Fremont had the lowest divorce rate in the United States and the fourth-highest sports participation rate. The fact is, Fremont is a strong and vibrant community with a city government that has worked hard to maintain economic prosperity within the city. We are surrounded by a lot of other cities. Indeed, being a suburb of San Francisco is no small feat. But Fremont capitalizes on its unique location in the heart of Silicon Valley. It is a technology-forward community that has created growth without waste or bloated spending.
Just consider for a moment the changes that Fremont has made. Did you know the final gasoline combustion car factory in California was right here in Fremont? That’s right. It closed in 2010. And guess who would go on to buy it? Elon Musk. From the past to the future. While much of the manufacturing at Tesla is done by machines, it still became the number one employer in Fremont very quickly. As a university in Fremont, we are proud to have students who have gone on to work for Tesla upon graduation.
Innovation Happens in Fremont
There is a reason why so many companies come to Fremont. At one point Fremont had the most startups per capita in the nation. What sets Fremont apart is the innovation clusters that grow here. With some of the most high-tech companies in America headquartered right here, incubators, accelerators, and private equity firms have money to spend. Longtime business professionals want to foster and grow companies that thrive on innovation.
Although there are other tech hot spots sprouting around the country, the Silicon Slopes being one example, none have come close to eclipsing the sheer number of technology companies thriving in our area. Fremont is also a very diverse city. More than 40% of Fremont’s population is foreign-born, which creates an environment of unique thought. It’s why our city is routinely thought of as an idea factory.
Being a dynamic, desirable city is what sets Fremont apart, and not only in the entire Bay Area or even the state. But in the country. Fremont’s population has grown by over 10% in 2020 and its median income is higher than the national standard, at $142,474. We hate to say all the happiness is about median income, but more money certainly does’nt hurt. Not all universities in Fremont graduate as many students to some of these high-paying jobs. We’re proud to say we have.
Beneficial Business Legislation in Fremont
Fremont has also created some interesting local ordinances and regulations to stimulate business growth. One such example was the creation of the “Small Business Ally” program nearly a decade ago. This program streamlined the permitting process at City Hall. Rather than forcing new companies to go through onerous red tape and endless bureaucracy, the City of Fremont assigned a single point of contact assistant to help new businesses get their legs under them. Having an individual on your side through the process prevents unnecessary paperwork and helps you corral important documents.
Some worried that assigning a single administrator to the program was dangerous. After all, that’s a lot of power and responsibility on one person. But it worked and the climate for small businesses and overall business growth improved in Fremont proper. It also helps surrounding areas prosper. Businesses had confidence that they had an ally on the inside and the state government was able to quickly scale up business growth and tax receipts.
Today, Fremont’s prosperity is clear and evident in the numbers. Fremont’s unemployment rate is only 2.6%. Highly skilled people from all over the world come to Fremont to start companies and help other companies grow and succeed. As a result, employers have a specific imperative to hire only the best people, no matter where they come from. And while housing costs are on the rise – as they are across the country – the city has expanded its services to help the needs of its citizens.
Lots For Students from a Fremont University to Do
One of the highlights of Fremont sits in the center of town. Many San Francisco Bay University students meet, study, and network at the Block at Pacific Commons and work in the Fremont Business Park, located on Christy Street. The Block has quickly become one of Fremont’s hottest entertainment and shopping districts. The area around the Block and business park is a hotbed of activity.
Fortunately, it’s easy for students to get around Fremont and out to the wider cities beyond. Public transportation servicing universities and colleges in Fremont is well-developed and reliable. Students need not wait long to catch a train or bus.
There is also a wealth of different outdoor activities well within reach of Fremont. Whether students want to get outside or stay within the bounds of the city proper, they have plenty of options. As a premier university in Fremont, SFBU is proud to call this amazing city home. We invite prospective students from around the world to consider Fremont when they consider an education.

  The Best Way to Write Your Personal Statement When Applying for a Scholarship






Are you ready to begin your journey toward attending a university and obtaining a degree that will change your life? The career of your dreams awaits at the end of that journey. Your destination is right there on the horizon. But are you concerned about how you will pay for your education? At San Francisco Bay University, we take great pride in providing scholarships, including housing scholarships, and tuition grants for students who seek to study here. After all, some of the best companies in the world call our area home. Whether it be for an MBA or otherwise, we offer scholarships for multiple disciplines. From BSCS to MSCS scholarships and more, it is important to us that students obtain the help they need. But why is that?
Each year, more than 1.7 million private scholarships and fellowships are awarded. This may seem like a big number, but also consider that approximately 19.4 million students attended U.S. colleges and universities per data reported in late 2020. That represents only 8.76% of potentially eligible students who receive a scholarship to attend the university of their choice. There is no doubt that more students, both locally and globally, would benefit from obtaining a scholarship, whether it be an MSCS scholarship or otherwise. And yet, obtaining a scholarship is not as easy as simply asking for one. There are a series of steps you must take to be on the receiving end of financial aid.
Colleges and universities generally look at a series of factors when considering whom to award a scholarship, grant, or other forms of financial aid. They include everything from previous academic performance (including GPA) to volunteerism and a demonstrated aspiration or passion toward their chosen field of study. One of the ways students show their aspiration or passion is in their personal statement. The personal statement is used to determine your level of interest and passion. It can be just as crucial to the process as what your high school GPA was. That’s why we wanted to dive a little deeper into what makes a personal statement truly stand out. Let’s use an application for an MSCS scholarship as one example.
Taking a Closer Look at an MSCS Scholarship Personal Statement
Let’s take for example a student who has already received her or his BSCS degree (Bachelor’s of Science in Computer Science) degree. Now they want to take their education and career opportunities to the next level. Yet, they may have already put all their financial resources into getting their initial degree. A scholarship might be just the answer to getting them across the finish line towards receiving their MSCS (Master’s of Science in Computer Science) degree.
A critical part of scholarship applications is the personal statement. Remember, you want to stand out from the crowd. Your personal statement should represent your best characteristics and provide you with an opportunity to stand out from the crowd. After all, you need to convince the committee deciding who receives MSCS scholarships that you are worthy of the award. You might have a truly remarkable curriculum vitae, but you are not the only remarkable student applying for this scholarship. After all, in the United States, there are roughly 65,000 CS graduates, which is less than China and Russia, but the quality of education is higher in the U.S., according to international university rankings. This means competition for scholarships in computer science and other disciplines is much tighter.
In many cases, it will be your personal statement that really sets you apart from applicants who have equal if not better qualifications than you do. Personal statements allow you to show your writing prowess and provide you with an opportunity to tell your story in a compelling way. The veracity of how you tell your story might be just what wins you that scholarship. Let’s take a closer look.
How to Build a Beautiful and Compelling Personal Statement
Your personal statement is an important part of an MSCS scholarship application. It’s about more than your birth name and identification number. A personal statement represents the ability to show how unique you are. Your personal statement needs to be good. Really good.
First, consider eliminating your character counter. Just let the thoughts flow and tell your story. The last thing you want is for your word count to hit the ceiling just as you are halfway through telling your story. Don’t panic, just keep writing. You can edit it later. In the end, you’ll find it’s easier to compress and remove superfluous things than to limit yourself.
Second, do not place an arbitrary time limit on preparing your statement. There is no need to rush. Reflect on your accomplishments and take a couple of hours to really dig into who you are and why you would be an excellent fit for a scholarship award. Find the perfect words and expressions that demonstrate your qualities and what makes you special. A good writer’s technique is to write a composition, take a break for a day or two, then come back and read it. Revelations may come to you after you’ve had a night to sleep on it.
Lastly, consider your language. To ‘accomplish’ something sounds so much better than to ‘do’ it. For international students who do not speak English as their first language, there are some good translation and synonym programs and search functionalities on the internet or in a physical thesaurus or dictionary. Whatever you use, there are many great resources to help you find better words to complete a thought in a more elegant or effective way. But do not be overly flowery in your verbiage. The true master shows skill while practicing restraint.
Above All, It’s About your Strengths
In the limited number of words that you have, it is important for you to sell yourself to the university. When a product is being offered to someone, the proponent of the product generally talks about how great that thing is. You are not a product, but there should be no problem talking about how great you are. Write about your experiences, your skills, your knowledge, and your future plans and desires. Why dwell on where you’ve gone wrong? No, you want to focus on where you’ve gone right. But it also might not hurt to show a bit of humility and articulate an experience in which you learned from a mistake.
As you focus on what you do best, make sure you include it somehow in your opening and closing statements. How you introduce yourself and what you conclude on will make all the difference in how the university administrator remembers your story. Starting with something funny, interesting, inspirational, or surprising will often provide a good first impression. Making someone smile is a great way to be introduced. But don’t dwell too long on your opening and closing statements. As you write out your personal statement, the proper opening and closing statements may just come to you out of nowhere.
Finally, do it yourself. Don’t pay someone to write it for you. It must be written in your own voice and be constructed of your own work and ideas. Here’s a pro tip: don’t read any other personal statements before reading yours. You are unique, and it will do you little good to follow someone else’s rules or patterns as to what you should do and how you should write it.
Now, how do you feel? Are you ready to sit down and write the best personal statement of your life? If you aren’t quite there yet but would like more information on MSCS scholarships or otherwise, get in touch with us today!

  A Closer Look at the Pros and Cons of a Bachelor in Business Administration






Unless you live deep within the Amazon jungle, then no matter where you are in the world, companies are there keeping the wheels of commerce greased. Consider America alone, and you’re looking at 32.5 million small business owners. Now also consider that 99.9% of all companies in the U.S. are small businesses and the scale of commerce in America becomes clear.
The fact is businesses generate jobs and opportunities. Businesses still operate even in countries that do not use capitalism as their primary economic system. Trade is going to happen no matter what. The real question comes down to how people settle trades. How do they conduct business? What do individuals need to succeed in business? Would a bachelor in business administration degree benefit you?
The Pros of a Bachelor in Business Administration
Consider that people pay a lot of money and take a lot of time to get a degree. Surely, they are all good for something. Right? Well, wrong. Not every degree is useful. But why not? Because you’ve got to obtain a degree that is practical for whatever career you choose. Consider an online bachelor’s degree in business administration. No matter what company, industry, or business you operate in, a business degree carries high esteem the world over. Both practical and challenging, a bachelor’s in business administration provides you with the real-world skills that today’s employers demand.
One of the most important parts of embarking on a new career is marketability. While you may be absolutely fantastic at what you do, how do potential employers or clients know that? A bachelor’s degree in business administration can provide you with the skills and knowledge that 21st-century companies look for. And just consider for a moment everything modern day businesses must deal with. From cybersecurity to artificial intelligence (AI), gone are the days when problems were simple and analog. That’s why a university’s comprehensive business program covers a wide array of topics.
When you enroll in a bachelor of business administration degree program, you’ll receive a broad business education – including the fundamentals of accounting, finance, operations, marketing, and more – that can distinguish you from your peers. But you can also specialize your major. At SFBU, we are surrounded by reputable companies who hire business administration specialists all the time.
Majors Associated with a Business Administration Degree
When someone refers to a business administration degree, they are generally talking about a bachelor’s degree in a specific area of business. Most university bachelor of business programs in the United States may be more general, focusing on a broad range of business functions and how they interact with one another. Or they may be more specialized, exploring in greater depth a singular area of business.
Generalist business degrees may be in areas such as business administration or business management. Those enrolled in a generalist business programs obtain a diverse set of skills and are trained well enough to work in any industry. Through elective courses, business students can place more emphasis in specialized areas such as marketing or finance.
We examined the following business majors based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics data for average annual salary and expected job growth over the next 10 years.
Accounting
Business Administration
Economics
Entrepreneurship
Finance
Forensic Accounting
Hospitality Management
Human Resources
International Business
Internet Marketing
Management
Management Information Systems
Marketing
Non-Profit Management
Project Management
Retail & Sales Management
Small Business
Sports Management
Supply Chain & Logistics
Are There a Lot of Career Opportunities for Business Administration Graduates?
No matter what you choose, each of these business major options can open the door to rewarding and lucrative career opportunities. You might be surprised to learn that quite a few high-demand career options have a business administration component. They include:
Health Services Manager: As a medical or health services manager you work behind the scenes at a hospital, doctor’s office, or another care facility. Your job is to keep it running safely and efficiently. You manage many operational duties of a health care facility from training to retention.
Human Resources Specialist/Manager: The role of the human resources specialist contributes to the wellbeing and development of an organization’s most precious asset, its people. This provides many opportunities for personal and professional growth and the development of both hard and soft people skills. HR jobs are commonly listed as one of the best business specialties to study.
Marketing Manager: As a marketing manager you serve as the link between a company and its customers. You will either work on, with, or manage a public relations or marketing team. The job may include managing budgets, testing market strategies, and monitoring key performance indicators and trends.
We choose these three examples to demonstrate the breadth of career options available to someone studying for their bachelor of business administration in the United States and around the world. Whether it be in the medical field, as an HR generalist, or in marketing, you can generally find a job in just about any industry or vertical with nothing more than a bachelor’s degree in business administration.
Is a Bachelor’s in Business Administration from SFBU Right for You?
Prospective students evaluating whether they should get a bachelor’s degree should consider the benefits, especially if the degree is in business. These include a higher potential income, increased job prospects, and new and enriching life experiences. If you’ve been working for a while, a bachelor’s degree may also help you launch a new career or advance in your current one. And then, of course, obtaining a bachelor’s can be the first step to getting a higher academic degree, like a master’s or a doctorate.
Students typically need at least 120 credits to graduate from a bachelor’s in business administration program in the US. Credits are acquired by passing classes for your major and other courses the school might require. College degrees generally take between four and five years to complete when you're enrolled full-time, but they can take longer or shorter depending on the program you enroll in and the number of classes you take each year. This is where you must ask yourself whether you have the time, funds, and desire to study business.
Are you ready to talk to someone about your future? Are you wondering if your career of choice is perfect for a bachelor in business administration degree? Furthermore, are there scholarships and tuition assistance to help you? These are all appropriate questions we can help you with. Simply head on over to our admissions page and then get in touch with us. One of our experienced admissions counselors will reach out and help you map out your future in business management.

How Should You Choose Your SFBU Program?
A 2019 study found that 51% of students were not confident in their career path when they enrolled in college. Statistics like these don’t make choosing your university program any easier.
There is a reason why attending a college or university is such a high-pressure decision. This is your career we’re talking about. This is about the rest of your life. It is no small matter and certainly requires a lot of thought and consideration. What you major in; what program you study – these decisions are not to be taken lightly.
That’s why the first and best thing you can do is study your interests. Ask yourself this simple question: “What interests me?” Because your interests are one of the biggest factors when considering a university program. And studying subjects that interest you makes university life a lot easier and more enjoyable.
Location is another important consideration. Are you considering a university program in Northern California? Certainly, this is an appealing environment, and where you are shapes what interests you. Think about choosing a university in a location with close proximity to companies where you might want to work upon graduation. San Francisco Bay University’s Silicon Valley location is very advantageous to students looking to land a job with one of the nearby tech companies.
It doesn’t hurt to talk to friends, family, or even faculty. Don’t hesitate to reach out with questions about your career and SFBU program choices. We’re here waiting to provide you with a first-class education.
Do you have questions? Here at SFBU, we have answers. Feel free to  contact one of our counselors or send us a message today. We welcome you to SFBU!

  How eLearning Benefits Students and Employees






At San Francisco Bay University, we are proud to be located at the epicenter of technological progress. Bay Area universities and other colleges and universities in Silicon Valley understand the importance of their location. That’s why we know the power of embracing technology within our teaching methods and utilizing eLearning as one of them. Depending on their program, our students have the option to study remotely, and doing so provides them with numerous benefits. Yet, many wonder, is eLearning beneficial? Do students miss out on anything studying remotely? You may be surprised to learn the concept of learning remotely goes way, way back.
Elearning Before There Were Computers
Although the term “eLearning” was first coined in 1999, the process of teaching someone through programmed learning material was born long before the turn of the century. In fact, teaching someone via “correspondence” can be traced all the way back to the 1840s, when an Englishman by the name of Isaac Pitman offered his shorthand course via correspondence. To this day, this is still considered the first widely adopted practice of distance education. Yet, eLearning would continue to evolve long before the first computer.
It was in 1924 that BF Skinner, a Harvard professor, invented what was then called “the teaching machine.” This machine essentially enabled teachers to administer programmed instruction to their students. It wasn’t until 1960 that Donald L. Bitzer at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign introduced a modern-day form of teaching that combined teaching and computing. PLATO, short for Programmed Logic for Automated Teaching Operations created one of the first online communities dedicated to computerized learning and foreshadowed the development of the internet and future eLearning teaching methodologies.
Although it was not until the 1960s that the first computer-based training program was introduced, it was these efforts by Isaac Pitman, BF Skinner, and others that set the stage for a method of teaching now relied upon by institutions and companies all over the world. Elearning has become widely accepted by schools, colleges, universities, and companies who want more efficient and effective ways to teach their students and employees. But therein lies the question. Is eLearning really efficient and effective?
The Different Elements of eLearning in Use Today
The world is rapidly moving towards an environment where technological utilization is becoming the norm. With the ever-increasing number of technological products, services, and applications changing the way we do business, communicate, and pass on information, the traditional ways of doing things are changing. And this includes how teachers and instructors teach and how students and employees learn. In a traditional classroom setting, an instructor has information available to them within that setting. Yet connecting students and employees to the outside world as they learn enhances their ability to construct and absorb new information.
As a term, eLearning (or E-learning depending on where you look) represents an umbrella term that refers to a variety of electronic teaching methodologies. Elearning provides access not only to educational material but also to the actual process by which the teaching is conducted. Elearning methodologies include:
Virtual classrooms
Web-portal learning
Digital collaboration
Audio and visual recording
Interactive teaching
Augmented reality
Virtual reality
Each new generation becomes evermore comfortable with technology. Thus, blending technology and learning provides a way for students who are used to using technology in their everyday lives to better understand the information being presented. There are so many different methodologies utilized by eLearning. And they are generally built within learning management systems (LMS). Learning management systems are very suitable for flexible learning methods, including “blended learning”, which is now so commonplace it has its own dictionary definition.
Aspects of Successful eLearning Programs
Elearning does not happen in a vacuum. When creating a course, managers, professors, or school administrators must make sure certain criteria are met. By doing so, they ensure the student or employee benefits fully from the course they signed up for or are required to take. For instance, the teacher or instructor must ensure they are available to answer questions or offer feedback to students. Many might assume one of the drawbacks of eLearning is a lack of availability when students need their instructors. And this is a drawback if the course is not properly managed. Students and employees must have access to their instructors when needed to ensure information is both received and retained.
As we mentioned before, an effective and user-friendly LMS is absolutely necessary. Students or employees must be able to easily navigate through and understand how the LMS works. Course material, tests, evaluations, and scores must be easily accessible to both students and teachers. In many cases, the backbone of an organization’s network will influence this factor. Company or university IT departments must ensure internal systems properly support the LMS in use.
Of course, a class is nothing without effective learning material, and this is where eLearning shines. Gone are the days when all an instructor had to work with were books, pens, paper, and a whiteboard. ELearning methodologies provide instructors with a plethora of tools - whether textual, audio, or visual - to communicate with and teach their students. And this may be one of the most important factors of eLearning: communication.
There are many ways, means, devices, tools, apps, and more that allow teachers and learners to communicate, collaborate, and share information. Whether it be through interactive multimedia, voice communication, live or prerecorded videos, digital presentations, or text, eLearning provides students and teachers with a whole new way to communicate and collaborate with each other. One university in the Netherlands used a modern LMS to connect thousands of students, resulting in a myriad of benefits for the entire institution.
How eLearning Benefits Students and Employees
One of the primary benefits of utilizing eLearning methods lies in its efficiency and flexibility. For example, an informal distribution model of eLearning is one in which the students or employees can view the course material, but said material is not used for testing or tracking purposes. Instead, the material can be accessed as a resource. This method is used primarily where blended learning is used.
More formal models of eLearning (and more often used) are those in which instructors keep track of and make recordings of how well their students are learning and retaining information. This is important for academic institutions like SFBU. Professors must have specific systems and standards in place to ensure the scores their students receive accurately reflect the level of learning and knowledge retention expected of them. In most cases, institutions and companies utilize learning management systems to provide and verify instruction.
Today, many colleges, universities, and companies of all shapes and sizes offer off-premise eLearning simply because it has so many advantages over traditional learning systems. Just a few of these include:
Flexibility: Learners can access material at any time and at their own pace.
Scope: Learners generally have access to thousands of online courses and information stored onsite or in the cloud. Companies using eLearning methods can upload policies, procedures, and other company-centric documents accessed with a click of a button.
Cost: Since universities and companies don’t have to bring students or employees into the classroom, eLearning often results in a cost reduction for students, institutions, and businesses. It’s a win-win-win.
Consistency: Teachers in a classroom present information in different ways. Elearning allows students to receive the same information in the same format every time a course is accessed.
We live in a fast-paced, technology-oriented world, and both students and employees want to know that the universities and companies they associate with offer cutting-edge teaching methodologies, of which eLearning is one. For many, eLearning is considered to be one of the defining methods of presenting and acquiring knowledge in the 21st century.

  Is a Master’s of Electrical Engineering Program Right for You






Are you interested in a career in electrical engineering? If so, consider the benefits of enrolling in a master’s of electrical engineering program. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics from 2021 to 2031 overall employment of electrical and electronics engineers is projected to grow by 3%? That may not seem like a lot, but when you consider the contraction happening in many other industries, a career in electrical engineering might not be such a bad idea.
Also, consider the level of pay electrical engineers enjoy. According to the same BLS statistics, electrical engineers start out in six figures with a degree in hand. In 2021, the average median pay for an electrical engineer was $101,780 per year, certainly nothing to shake a stick at. Yet, a career in electrical engineering may not be for everyone. It is important you do a careful evaluation of your career goals to determine whether the field is right for you.
A Masters of Electrical Engineering as a Forever Career
Can you imagine a world without the use of electricity? There is little doubt that electricity is one of the most civilization-changing inventions of humankind. Today, in the 21st century, electricity touches every aspect of our lives. From the moment you wake up until you go to bed, electricity is with you. And because electricity is so ubiquitous in our lives, there are a lot of different types of electrical engineers and electrical engineering professionals.
Hence, there is a lot of scope for professionals holding an electrical engineering degree from a top engineering university in San Francisco. The fact is electrical engineering is a promising career option for young professionals as there are literally thousands of job opportunities available in the field. You can work in any field that uses electricity. Just consider that electricity touches almost every field and industry. No matter where you want to work, chances are electricity is used in some fashion.
Today, job security is on everyone’s mind. With inflation hitting 40-year highs and instability plaguing the globe, everyday people worry about whether their job is on the chopping block. Fortunately, for electrical engineers, job security is virtually guaranteed. Those who obtain a master’s in electrical engineering degree can rest assured that their skills will be in high demand for a long time to come. Of course, if you have already obtained your bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering, then you probably have already done your career due diligence. You’ve already chosen this field of study. Now, you may be wondering what’s next. What can you expect to learn as you take your electrical engineering studies to the next level?
What Will You Study as You Pursue Your MSEE?
The Master of Electrical Engineering is a 2–3-year degree (full-time) depending on your prior study. In your first year (or equivalent) you’ll complete foundation engineering subjects. These subjects are specifically tailored to students from non-engineering backgrounds. If you’ve completed the Electrical Systems major in the Bachelor of Science at another university, plus the required math and science subjects, then you will get credit for these foundation engineering subjects.
By your second or third year of studies, it will be time to dig into your area of specialty. It will be time to put some time into your desired discipline. Your professors will guide you in acquiring and honing the core skills you need to excel in your chosen discipline. You can expect to study things like:
Embedded Systems Engineering
Embedded Software Design
Internet of Things (IoT)
Machine Learning & AI
Python Programming
Advanced Digital IC Design
Multi-core Computing
As part of your advanced studies, you can also expect to be assigned an industry, design, or research project. This project will be used by your professors to evaluate the knowledge you’ve gained and retained.
Is a Master’s in Electrical Engineering Worth It?
It is important to remember that an MSEE is not usually a career requirement. However, it is recommended if students and professional engineers want to enhance their skills. Of course, undergraduate degrees are important, as they help students gain a fundamental knowledge of basic sciences. This generally includes physics, mathematics, and engineering. And while many engineers go on to get great jobs with just a bachelor’s degree, it may limit the scope of positions they may qualify for.
That’s where a master’s degree comes in. Master’s programs are specifically designed to help students hone skills that will be essential for a long and lucrative career in electrical engineering. The skills learned in a master’s program include strong technical, creative, communication, problem-solving, and critical-thinking skills. They will serve the master’s graduates in more than just their engineering field. These are life skills that will come in handy in numerous circumstances.
Beyond learning new skills, graduating with a master’s in electrical engineering can boost a candidate’s job prospects. For those looking for new or enhanced career opportunities and a higher salary, an MSEE will provide them. It is also important to remember that employers may require specialized electrical engineering applicants to have a master’s degree with a specialty in the area of focus they are looking for.
The same goes for leadership positions. Many employers require a master’s degree for project manager or senior engineer positions. Not only is a wealth of experience important, but that advanced degree may be just what is needed to get that lucrative leadership position. In the end, earning a master’s degree can improve an individual’s employment opportunities and income potential. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), median weekly earnings for individuals with a master’s degree were nearly $250 greater than for those with just a bachelor’s, while the unemployment rate for master’s holders was almost 1.5% lower.
Here at San Francisco Bay University, we proudly offer MSEE programs designed to help students accelerate their careers and reach new heights. We also offer generous scholarship programs and tuition assistance for students who need it. Contact our admissions office to learn more!

  Our 10 Favorite Outdoor Activities in the Bay Area






Welcome to bright and beautiful San Francisco! Here at SFBU, we are so proud to be part of the San Francisco Bay Area. California’s fourth-largest city checks all the boxes when it comes to being a world-class metropolis. From outstanding museums to great shopping, a diverse array of restaurants, and a dynamic startup scene - San Francisco is the place to be for anyone who wants to live in a city that has it all. No wonder students from all over the world want to attend a university in San Francisco! Yet, this is a city that also has plentiful natural beauty and open spaces.
Even though San Francisco is a bustling metro area, it boasts over  3,400 acres  of wide open spaces for people to explore and enjoy. In fact, there are so many green spaces in San Francisco, every resident lives within a 10-minute walk of a park or green space.
Of course, San Francisco’s most famous public space is the Golden Gate Park, which covers over 1,000 acres of lakes, gardens, and beautiful Redwood trees. And yet, there are so many other smaller parks and open areas - from Hawk Hill to Buena Vista Park - for residents and students to choose from. Even more, there are plenty of options for those who want to leave the hustle and bustle of the big city in search of adventure.
Just across the Golden Gate Bridge are the Marin Headlands, which are home to nearly 140 miles of trails. For avid campers, a 25-minute ferry ride leads to Angel Island State Park. The fact is, students attending SFBU have access to a wide array of outdoor activities, from hiking to birdwatching and so much more. That’s why we want to tell you all about them in our latest blog. Let’s dig a little deeper into our 10 favorite outdoor activities in and around the city we love.
1. The Golden Gate Bridge and Park
We would be remiss if we did not start with the most iconic and well-known structures and outdoor areas in the Bay Area: The Golden Gate Bridge. While this may seem like an obvious first choice, the area around the Golden Gate Bridge provides for spectacular outdoor fun. Golden Gate Park is the place to go if you want to get out of the city without actually leaving the city.
Golden Gate Park offers a natural refuge for outdoors enthusiasts smack in the middle of San Francisco’s urban density. Covering an area nearly a mile-and-a-half large, Golden Gate Park is big enough to whisk you away from the sights, smells, and sounds of the city. Check out these points of interest within the park:
Japanese Tea/Botanical Garden
National AIDS Memorial Grove
Strawberry Hill
Stowe Lake
Hippie Hill
You may even get the opportunity to check out a herd of American bison in the park, which roam in an area near Spreckels Lake. These majestic animals have been a treasured part of the park for over a century.
2. Kayaking the San Francisco Bay
As a university in San Francisco, our students have access to a vast array of outdoor activities. And one of the most popular of those activities includes kayaking on the bay. Getting out on the water is an exciting and beautiful way to get up close and personal with the waters around San Francisco.
Did you know that it is even possible to paddle out to watch a San Francisco Giants game from the water? That’s right! For a truly unique Northern California experience, kayak out to McCovey Cove during a baseball game and enjoy the roar of AT&T Park without the need for a ticket. For students who may not have a kayak handy, City Kayak provides rental options and information for potential kayakers.
For those who want real adventure, head out into San Francisco Bay and paddle in the waters around Angel Island, Sausalito, Tamales Bay, and many other locations. For more information on kayaking safely in San Francisco Bay, check out the Bask Bay Area Sea Kayakers page.
3. The Mount Sutro Open Space Reserve
Just a few blocks south of Golden Gate Park is a 61-acre green space owned by the University of California, San Francisco. Many have described this idyllic space to be similar to a cloud forest. The iconic fog that rolls in from the bay creates a magical setting atop the reserve. And it is the perfect place to escape from the heat of the sun during a hot San Francisco day.
For those looking for a good hike, the reserve also contains over five miles of hiking and mountain-biking trails. Adventure seekers and casual hikers alike will love the Historic Trail or the West Ridge Trail before heading to the Mount Sutro summit itself. The North Ridge is another great option, which loops through old-growth blue-gum eucalyptus and cedar trees.
4. Fort Funston
Just across from Lake Merced Park and San Francisco State University lies Fort Funston and Funston Beach, long a favorite of San Francisco residents and visitors alike. Established in 1900, the area was originally the Lake Merced Military Reservation. It was in 1917 that a fort was constructed and the area renamed Fort Funston.
With windswept views of the beach and a large network of trails around the fort, Fort Funston offers plenty of activities for nature lovers. Birdwatchers will enjoy large colonies of bank swallows nesting in the nearby sandstone cliffs. It’s one of only two places in California where these endangered birds nest.
Finally, consider Fort Funston for sunset. Sit atop the hill and gaze upon the setting sun as it dips below the Pacific Ocean. San Francisco residents will tell you, this is the best spot in town to catch a gorgeous sunset.
5. Buena Vista Park
Translated from Spanish meaning “good view,” Buena Vista Park is the most appropriately named - and oldest - park in the San Francisco Bay Area. Students visiting the park will find beautiful views of the Golden Gate Bridge and Marin Headlands through thick groves of Cork Oak and Bailey’s Acacia trees.
Established in 1867, the hill in Haight-Ashbury also has an interesting past. The northeast staircase at the entrance of the park contains a peace symbol made of flower paintings. It’s a piece of art that nods to San Francisco’s past when Buena Vista Park was the center of San Francisco counterculture.
For provisions on your way to the park, stop by the  Haight Street Market, which is only a five-minute walk from the park. And here’s an insider tip for you: You don’t need to hike to the top of the hill for the best views. Instead, find “The Window,” an opening located lower on the west side of the park. The views of the Marin Headlands and Drakes Bay are spectacular.
6. San Francisco Beaches
We would be remiss if we did not add any beach activities to this list. After all, as a coastal city, enjoying the sun and surf is quintessential to being a San Franciscan. Your first stop should be Baker Beach, which is located near the Golden Gate bridge. As part of the Golden Gate National Recreation area, this is a great place to relax after a long, hot day of hiking. Just keep in mind the water here is generally not safe for swimming.
China Beach is another visually stunning beach with a northward facing view of the Marin Headlands and the Golden Gate Bridge. The rock walls on both sides of the beach create a small protected area that once was a camp for Chinese fishermen, hence the name. And the area just south of the cove is called Lands End, where you’ll find an interesting hidden surprise called the Lands End Labyrinth.
Another interesting hidden gem are the Sutro Baths, which are calm saltwater and freshwater pools. This historical site is surrounded by a beautiful beach and stunning green headlands. It’s a lesser-known area with a unique history.
Also consider:
Mile Rock Beach
Kirby Cove Beach
Rodeo Beach
Muir Beach
Bolinas Beach
7. The Marin Headlands
We’ve mentioned it enough throughout this article, so why not share some of its history and appeal? Known for its unique geology and fog-swept coastal prairie ecosystem, the Marin Headlands are a diverse and historic part of San Francisco’s natural history. With dramatic cliffs of oceanic rock offering sweeping views of the Golden Gate Bridge, this area is a must-do for students yearning for some fresh air and natural wonder.
The centerpoint of the Marin Headlands is the 920-foot Hawk Hill, which (attention birdwatchers!) is the lookout point for the largest known flight of diurnal raptors in the Pacific states, hence the name. Not only is Hawk Hill a prime destination for biologists, it also holds great appeal for hikers and cyclists.
The Marin Headlands human history is long and layered. It’s original occupants were the Coast Miwok Native Americans, who lived there for thousands of years. In modern times, it evolved into a military hot spot for coastal defense during the Cold War. Today, it serves as a welcome spot for local and international visitors looking for a taste of natural San Francisco.
8. Quarry Lakes Regional Recreation Area
We couldn’t very well provide a list of outdoor activities in San Francisco without paying some attention to options right here in Fremont. SFBU students won’t have to go far to get away and enjoy some fresh air.
Let’s start with the Quarry Lakes Regional Recreation Area. Located on the east bay side in Fremont, it’s a large regional park with several man-made lakes that offers picnicking, boating, swimming, and trails for hiking and wildlife viewing. The trails are wide and it’s fairly easy to walk around the various lakes.
Students can utilize the lake for water-related activities, from swimming to fishing, windsurfing, and boating. The area is also used to recharge aquifers in the Niles Cone Groundwater Basin, so it is not only a great place for outdoor activities, it supports the water needs of millions of San Franciscans.
9. Mission Peak
Mission Peak rises steeply to the east behind Fremont and offers a nice hike for those who want to peak a mountain without leaving the Fremont area. It’s also a popular place for parasailing and hang gliding as the winds off San Francisco Bay rise up its sides. You can also enjoy some stunning views of other mountain ranges from its peak, including:
Mount Tamalpais
Mount Diablo
Mount Hamilton
Both experienced and novice hikers can find accommodating trails in the hills in and around Mission Peak. With trails and parkland easily accessible from the SFBU campus, this is a first stop for student adventurers seeking fresh air and sun.
10. The Arden Historic Farm
And for our final entry on this list, we bring you to the Ardenwood Historic Farm, an unexpected option for SFBU students looking for something more off the beaten path. It offers a glimpse into life on an American family farm between 1890 and 1930. International students can expect a fascinating look into the history of their host country.
While the farm makes up the remnants of a once vast private estate, today it is a working farm open to the public. Staff and volunteers utilize carefully restored farm machinery to harvest and process crops once common in the region. There’s also a farmyard with a variety of animals, a large hay barn, an outdoor kitchen, and a working blacksmith. Being a historic farm, you can expect renovated, but historically accurate buildings, beautiful grounds, and a lovely Victorian farmhouse with formal gardens.
Today, Ardenwood demonstrates the vital role farms have played in providing resources, driving innovation, and bringing and keeping communities together. To find out what activities and schedules are around the farm - as well as information for other East Bay parks - check out the East Bay Regional Park District’s Naturalist Program Schedule. This should be your resource for parks and recreation information in Fremont and the surrounding area.
Wow, what a list, right? We had a blast putting it together! As SFBU students, we understand you work hard, so you deserve to get out and enjoy the beauty the Bay Area has to offer. As a Northern California university, we are grateful for the natural wonders of our state. Enjoy them!

  Best Activities for Parents Visiting the Bay Area and SFBU






Uh oh! Are your parents visiting you at SFBU and your room’s a mess? Maybe you just aren’t ready to introduce them to all the wonderful things you’ve been learning at one of San Francisco’s premier universities. Well, that’s okay! We understand you’ve got a lot going on with your studies. That’s why it is important to recommend some awesome activities for your parents to enjoy while you get fully prepped for their visit. Fortunately, we’ve got some great recommendations to keep your parents occupied.
Consider how impressed your parents will be when you introduce them to all these fabulous activities. As a student of SFBU, planning and time management are important. So, why not prove to your parents how good you are at planning and time management by suggesting some amazing San Francisco excursions for them?
Consider that your parents have spent your life putting your interests ahead of theirs. Perhaps now is the time to show them some of the same consideration and attention. It’s easy to recommend museums, bars, theaters, or shopping. But how about something unique for your parents who have helped you get to a point where a world-class education at SFBU is possible? Here are some amazing unique activities they (and even you!) can enjoy.
1. Alcatraz Island
Alcatraz Island is a fascinating place for anyone, from parents to students, friends, and family. Alcatraz reveals stories of American incarceration, justice, and our common humanity. It has been many things over the years, from a fort to a military prison and maximum-security federal penitentiary. It was even once occupied by the American Indian Movement in the name of freedom and Native American civil rights.
When it was a prison, some of the most infamous names in criminality were imprisoned there, from Al Capone to George “Machine Gun” Kelly. The cells in Alcatraz measure 10 feet by 4.5 feet. Could you imagine being imprisoned in such a place? In 1972, Alcatraz became part of the newly created Golden Gate National Recreation Area. And although there has been no effort to repair the structures on the island, their general decay and disrepair only add to the disquiet that surrounds the facility. This is one of the top tourist destinations in San Francisco and for good reason!
For more information on operating hours, seasons, and more, visit the website for the National Park Service by clicking or tapping  here.
2. The California Academy of Sciences
We wanted to offer something more than the casual museum experience. So, why not recommend your parents visit the California Academy of Sciences? This attraction offers things to see and do beyond a simple museum. It also offers a Natural History Museum, an aquarium, a planetarian, and more. It’s even become a go-to for the scientific community. And for those of you who have parents fond of architectural wonders, they will be interested to learn that the entire facility underwent a conversion in 2008 by the Italian architect Renzo Piano. Today, the Academy is a green building with a design that has become an iconic part of the culture and history of San Francisco.
﻿﻿The Academy also offers state-of-the-art technology and design to dazzle and wow you and your parents. The planetarium boasts the world’s largest all-digital dome with a 360-degree surround screen that will transport you to distant worlds and galaxies. From short films in Hohfeld Hall to rainforest recreations and a live penguin display, there’s a lot to learn – and love – at the California Academy of Sciences.

The California Academy of Sciences is open from 9:30am to 5:00pm every day except Sunday when they are open 11:00am to 5:00pm. Tickets are $35.95 for adults, $30.95 for seniors, and $25.95 for children 4 to 11. Children under 3 get in free. For more information click or tap here.
3. Sunset Dinner at The Cliff House
Your parents will thank you for recommending a romantic dinner at the elegant Cliff House. With two options – either the Bistro Restaurant or Sutro’s Restaurant – your parents will dine well and enjoy a spectacular view of the sunset over the Pacific Ocean. On Sundays, the terrace room offers a champagne brunch buffet with all-you-can-drink champagne and a live harpist. There is also a Friday night jazz offering, because whose parents don’t like a seaside dinner, sunset, and jazz?
In the end, it really isn’t about what day of the week your parents visit. Instead, it’s about the amazing view and excellent ambiance. No matter what table you’re sitting at, you’ll get an awesome view of the Marin headlands and Sea Rocks. They even offer a California seaside-inspired lunch that is based purely on the catch of the day.
Prices are modest and reservations are recommended as this is a popular spot with San Franciscans and out-of-town visitors alike. A recommendation to the Cliff House will surely impress your parents and remind them that you’ve got their comfort and entertainment in mind! Click or tap here to go to their website.
4. Fisherman’s Wharf
The only reason we did not make this the number one option is simply because that would have been too obvious. Whether you are new to the San Francisco area or not, you’ve likely heard of or been down to Fisherman’s Wharf. It is usually high on the list of things to do for those visiting the Bay Area. Fisherman’s Wharf was known for being a cultural hot spot back in the early days of the city.
/p>

When eager prospectors were participating in the San Francisco Gold Rush, Chinese immigrants were catching salmon, shrimp, and oysters and selling it all at Fisherman’s Wharf. Before long Italians, Irishmen, and many others from all over the world began adding their cultural beliefs and styles to the diverse milieu that was becoming San Francisco Bay. From Fleet Week to the raucous, carnival-like atmosphere at Pier 39, Fisherman’s Wharf is a cornucopia of fun and a feast for the senses.
From the Wharf, your parents can head on down to Hyde Pier, which is a world apart from “modern” San Francisco. From the paddlewheel tug to the old fishing boats and schooners, Hyde Pier will take your parents back in time as they gaze upon the San Francisco of yesterday. Visit Fisherman’s Wharf’s website for the official list of things to do on the Wharf and beyond.
5. Ride the Cable Car
Who doesn’t love to ride in a cable car and take in the beautiful vistas around them? This is one activity that has made San Francisco immortal, if for nothing else than the number of movies that have featured the Powell-Hyde cable car. The cable cars will take you and your parents along three routes where they can visit the most popular parts of San Francisco. From Fisherman’s Wharf to Union Square, Aquatic Park, Lombard Street, and finally Nob Hill – your parents will see it all without having to worry about being stuck in traffic or waiting for a cab. Dazzle your parents as you point out the 1873 red cars with the golden bells in front. There is even a cable car museum they can check out if they want to learn more.
The cable car rides are scheduled at 10-minute intervals throughout the day. They start at Union Square and end at Nob Hill. Tickets cost around $6 USD for those between 5 and 64, and $3 USD for the disabled and seniors. Check out all the history and ride and payment information at the official San Francisco Cable Car website!
Well, we hope you’ve enjoyed this romp through some of the best activities to recommend to your parents when they visit you at San Francisco Bay University. Consider that there is also so much more you can recommend. From trying out Papalote’s burritos to Mojo’s sandwiches and Little Star’s pizza, there are awesome foodie options for them to discover in the Bay Area as well.
Sure, your parents may have heard stories that San Francisco is full of crime and overpriced avocado toast, but as an SFBU student, you know that’s not the case. That’s why it's important to introduce them to the San Francisco you know and love. Make them proud of you and your consideration for their needs while they visit our fair city. And finally, enjoy the best things to do in San Francisco for you and your parents!

  How to Prepare and Apply for a Scholarship in 4 Easy Steps






Welcome to the San Francisco Bay University’s Scholarship Series, where we dive deep into the hows and whys of scholarships and the opportunities they present. For instance, one question a student will be able to answer by the end of our series is how to get a computer science scholarship at a university in the USA! But more than telling you how to apply for it, we are going to advise you on the best ways to prepare. How will you stand out amongst your peers?
Did you know that over 1.7 million scholarships are awarded each year? At SFBU, we are proud to be among the number of colleges and universities that help students get the funds they need to get a higher education. Scholarships come in all shapes and sizes. But before we get into the nuts and bolts of applying for a scholarship, let's talk about how you should prepare.
1. Get that University Scholarship by Staying Organized
You are getting ready to make one of the biggest decisions in your life: going to college or university. You may be asking yourself, “If I want to get a computer science scholarship, how do I do it?” We use computer science as our example in this article, but you can apply for an SFBU scholarship in many of our programs. Still, before you do, it is important to always stay organized and don’t let your nerves get the best of you.
Yes, when you apply for a scholarship, you are doing so in conjunction with many other applicants. But don’t worry. Stay calm and focused and properly organize and prepare your materials. Staying organized is the key to putting your scholarship application together. You will be asked to prepare multiple documents for submission and verification. And since you are competing with other applicants, staying organized keeps you ahead of the game.
Whether it be your transcripts, or personal statements, everything must be well organized and ready for submission. Remember to have a comprehensive list at the ready with your volunteer involvement, extracurricular activities, and transcripts included. Consider creating a calendar with all your scholarship deadlines. Or you can rely on an app like Microsoft To Do, which will help you stay organized and on top of your required tasks.
2. What Should You Put in Your Scholarship Statement?
Your personal scholarship statement represents one of the most important aspects of your application process. It’s vital that you spend some time thinking about how to write your personal statement. You’ve got to do it in such a way that it properly expresses who you are and why you deserve the scholarship for which you apply.
A personal statement should also be well structured and written in a way that will make you stand out. It should paint a positive picture of you as a person, student, and potential scholarship recipient. Approach how you share this information from a storytelling perspective. Here are just a few questions to consider as you assess your personal statement:
What are your strongest personality traits?
Do you have attributes, qualities, skills, or talents that set you apart from other applicants?
Can you provide a list of what you consider major life accomplishments?
Why did you choose your area of study and what are your career goals?
How will the scholarship help you achieve your goals?
Also, consider breaking your personal statement into several manageable segments. Start with an introduction that grabs your reader’s attention. You can include family background or circumstances that impact your need for financial assistance here. Then construct the body of your statement out of a paragraph or two, discussing the bullet points above. Finally, create a conclusion and consider it your last chance to impress and persuade those on the Scholarship Committee.
3. When Should You Apply for a University Scholarship for Computer Science or Other Programs?
You’ve heard the saying: The early bird gets the worm. Only in this case, the worm happens to be a significant chunk of free money to help get you through your studies. Many scholarship winners will attest to the fact that an early application was critical to their success.
It is important to be aware of the timelines involved in a scholarship application process. At SFBU, we operate on a trimester system, thus, an early application is as soon as the application window is open. For example, SFBU opened our spring applications on April 5th, and the deadline to submit the application is Oct 15th. As such, students who want to make the best impression first should have their scholarship applications ready on or shortly after April 5th. So, if yours isn’t already in, get it in now!
Scholarships of all varieties are not infinite. Universities in California - and elsewhere - have a specific amount of scholarship funding available. That way, the earlier you apply, the more likely you’ll be to receive the scholarship award you want.
4. Specific Steps Involved with Applying for an SFBU Scholarship
At SFBU, we offer several scholarships. They include:
President’s Scholarship for California Community College (CCC) Transfer Students (Bachelors)
President’s Scholarship - Bachelor's Degree (100% Tuition)
President’s Scholarship - Master's Degree (100% Tuition)
Housing Scholarship (100% Tuition + Free University Housing)
To learn more about each of these scholarships, simply visit the scholarships and grants section of our website. Applying for a scholarship has three steps since the application is integrated with the application for admission. Applicants don't need to apply separately or after they have been admitted. We combine the process.
The steps are easy:
Select the scholarship option you want to apply for when you complete your online application.
Then you will need to upload your scholarship personal statement.
The Scholarship Committee will review your application and you will be notified.
It really is as simple as that. There are no complicated steps or tough hoops to jump through. San Francisco Bay University is proud to provide 100% tuition assistance scholarships for students in the United States and around the world. And we invite you, before you begin your scholarship application process, to take a virtual tour of our campus!

  SFBU Student’s Guide: How to Get Around the Bay Area






If California is known for one thing, it is the big, sprawling cities that anchor the northern and southern ends of the state. In Southern California, Los Angeles and San Diego together form one, gigantic megalopolis. And yet, Southern California is not well-known for its public transportation system. We’ve all heard of New York’s subway and Chicago’s L-train, but have you heard of the L.A. subway? The situation is a little different in Northern California, where San Francisco’s famous BART heavy-rail public transportation system is quite well-known. Short for Bay Area Rapid Transit, BART connects San Francisco colleges and universities with downtown San Francisco, Chinatown, restaurants, the Golden Gate Bridge, and so much more.
The fact is public transportation systems are part of the backbone of any city. Public transportation provides people with a higher level of mobility, especially in poor or underserved areas. In Fremont and Silicon Valley, not only does public transportation open up routes to San Francisco colleges and universities, no matter how near or far, but it provides access to employment, community resources, healthcare, and recreational activities. Public transportation benefits not only people who choose to ride it but those who have no other choice. According to data from the Federal Highway Administration, over 90% of public assistance recipients do not own a car and instead rely on public transportation to get around.
Comprehensive and widespread public transportation systems are critical for the health of any city, but especially the big ones. Consider that slightly more than 70% of all transit trips are made by passengers who use public transportation five days or more per week. Pre-COVID, San Francisco public transportation had swelled to its highest ridership in recorded history. The BART system recorded, at its height, 426,758 riders in September of 2019. Today, ridership is well below the peak but is recovering. In January 2021, BART recorded 43,012 riders. This past January 2022, it nearly doubled to 83,790 riders. But is the BART the only way to get around? Fortunately, whether you are going to or from San Francisco colleges and universities or heading out to partake in a great outdoor activity, you’ve got options.
A Comprehensive Guide to Getting To and From San Francisco Colleges and Universities
Are you ready for a comprehensive San Francisco public transportation system guide? We’ve got you covered. This primer will ensure you get where you need to go without the excess stress. San Francisco’s public transportation system is managed by the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA). The SFMTA governs everything from bicycle lanes to paratransit, parking, buses, traffic, taxis, railways, ferries, and cable cars.
Public transportation in the Bay Area is quite extensive, which can also lead to it being a bit confusing. It includes a rapid transit system, three commuter rail lines, two light rail systems, two ferry systems, Amtrak inter-city rail services, and four major overlapping bus agencies, in addition to dozens of smaller ones.
San Francisco residents, current students, prospective students, and other visitors to our great city have a wide variety of ticket options, transit passes, and modes of transportation to choose from. Let’s dive right in. These are the four primary methods of public transportation in the metro area.
1. Cable Cars and Streetcars: Did you know that the San Francisco cable car system is the last manually operated cable car system in the world? The cable car system in San Francisco is part of the intermodal transportation network operated by the San Francisco Municipal Railway (SFMR). The SFMR itself combines the Muni Metro modern light rail system with the E Market, F Market, and wharves streetcar lines. The first cable car was put into operation in 1873, which also makes San Francisco cable cars one of the oldest cable car lines in the country. And while there were 23 cable car lines at its height, today only three lines remain. What makes cable cars different from other forms of public transportation in San Francisco is their user demographic. Rather than commuters, most of the cable car ridership is composed of tourists. Need routes or schedules? Here you go: SFMTA Cable Cars Information.
2. Buses: San Francisco is a fairly large city with hundreds of buses circulating around its downtown area and beyond, which means a local bus can take you just about anywhere. One of the best ways to get acclimated to the San Francisco bus system is to grab a transport map. Bus stops also have maps on large panels for easy reading. While bus operating times depend on the line, most run between 5:00am and 1:00am. Frequencies also depend on line and time, but one thing you can count on is that all lines that run through the city center will go by every ten minutes or less. Bus fare is generally $2.00 for adults and $0.75 for children 5 to 17 and seniors over 65. For more information on routes and schedules, go here: San Francisco Muni Routes & Stops.
3. Trains: While the San Francisco train system is comprehensive, it can also be quite confusing. The SFMT train system includes BART, Caltrain, Golden Gate Transit, VTA, AC Transit, SamTrans, and Amtrak Inter-City. These systems make up light rail and commuter trains. The Caltrain itself is over 150 years old and is one of the oldest methods of public transportation in San Francisco. When combined with the bus system, city trains can get you just about anywhere, whether you're going to one of San Francisco’s colleges or universities or otherwise. Since there are so many train options, we’ve found a site that connects you to all of them here: San Francisco Trains. Also, here is the official list of BART Schedules and Maps. The BART Trip Planner also provides an interactive map that students can use to plan their trips.
4. Ferries: Being a coastal city, San Francisco also provides access to ferries. While they run on limited schedules, ferries offer calm, quick, traffic-free, and beautiful ways to get around the region. In fact, the San Francisco ferry system is the oldest method of public transportation in the city, with the first ferry being a sailboat ferry going into service in 1826. Today, the San Francisco Bay Ferry and the Golden Gate Transit Ferry are the two primary ferries in San Francisco. Here are your San Francisco Bay Ferry Schedules and Golden Gate Ferry Schedules.
Public Transportation Options in Fremont, California
You need to know all the public transportation options in greater San Francisco if you want to get around the region. But while SFBU is part of the greater San Francisco colleges and universities area, it is still located specifically in Fremont. So, what are the best tips and tricks for students and otherwise who want to make their way around, in, out, and back to Fremont, California?
1. The most widely used and easily accessible station is the BART Fremont Station. From the BART Fremont Station, students can either continue farther out to Warm Springs, Milpitas, or Berryessa or head the other direction into San Francisco proper or the airport.
2. The AC Transit Fremont Station also provides transit options from Fremont into town and back. For AC Transit Station bus schedules check out the AC Transit Trip Planner.
3. Finally, the Altamont Commuter Express (ACE) runs weekdays between Stockton and San Jose and serves ten stations, including Lathrop/Manteca, Tracy, Vasco Road, Livermore, Pleasanton, Fremont, Great America, and Santa Clara.
Why Are Public Transportation Systems So Important?
Public transportation systems are a vital component of the healthy functioning of cities large and small. Consider for a moment that in 2018 alone, over 914,000 California workers commuted to and from work on a public transportation system. Without an updated and viable public transportation system, local municipalities and their economies would crumble. Even more, the environment would be far worse off.
There is little doubt that the benefits of public transportation are amplified when transit networks are planned, engineered, and implemented with interconnectivity, rider experience, and efficiency in mind. Well-thought-out public transportation systems have free amenities like public Wi-Fi, climate control, and cell phone chargers. They may also provide access to food and drink through on-site convenience stores or other retail outlets.
In the end, there is a reason why U.S. News & World Report ranked San Francisco in a tie for first place with New York on their 10 Best Cities for Public Transportation list. With over 650,000 jobs accessible within a 30-minute ride, residents and SFBU students alike can probably get to work faster on public transportation than sitting in traffic.
San Francisco also has a high commuter-to-rider ratio, with 36.5% of daily commuters using public transit. And really, it should be no surprise considering San Francisco has 26 transit routes within a half-mile of each other. Whether you are an SFBU student making your way to and/or from one of San Francisco’s best university campuses or making your way around other cities, favorite beaches, or suburbs in the area, you can rely on San Francisco’s public transit system to get you there!

  The Student's Guide: 5 Things to Consider When Choosing a Northern California University






Did you know that there are 90 universities in Northern California? And there’s a good reason for it. California’s $2.6 trillion economy is larger than all but half a dozen countries worldwide. This is the home of some of the largest tech companies in the world. The people in California are known for being warm and welcoming. We stand open to the world. California is also famous for its warm weather, stunning coastal beaches, and hoppin’ cities. From Hollywood to Silicon Valley, California has it all. But why do so many non-California residents choose a university in Northern California?
Nationally, Northern California is a significant contributor to the agricultural, aerospace, and manufacturing sectors, which is why many universities have created high-quality and affordable programs that focus on engineering and technology, among other fields. Because of its size, Northern California is a large area, which allows students to choose just about any field of study. And some of the nation’s top universities are right here in Northern California. This area is known for the high quality of its academic institutions. And with some of the biggest and most influential companies here in Northern California, our universities provide highly-educated and success-driven graduates for their recruiting programs. Here at SFBU, we are proud to sit right smack in the midst of some of the top technology companies in the world. And we are also proud to have had some of our students move on to jobs at these very companies.
Are you a prospective student considering California as a destination for higher education? Certainly, there are some considerations. Universities in Northern California and around the San Francisco area have a lot to offer, but Northern California is not for everyone. Let’s take a look at the top 5 things you should consider when choosing a Northern California University.
1. Location, Location, Location
It isn’t just about where you buy a house or start a business. Universities in Northern California are spread across a wide geographic area. If you are a local student, you may live at home or with relatives. However, international students who travel here to study may need to consider distance and public transportation. Not everyone will have a car. Fortunately, San Francisco has been ranked as the second best city for public transportation.
Expenses must also be considered. Certainly, leaving home and striking out on your own is exciting. No longer living under your parents roof and socializing with other students is going to be fun, but you must also be self-reliant. There are a lot of activities that students attending a university in Northern California can choose from when it comes to things to do. Not everything is free. But fortunately, our geographic location offers tons of opportunities for great outdoor fun which is generally free or inexpensive.
The good news is that one of SFBU’s scholarship programs provides housing assistance. And, our housing options allow for ease of access to local restaurants and activities. As with your normal application, we recommend completing your housing request as soon as possible as housing assistance is provided on a first come first served basis. Getting your paperwork in early is important no matter what university you apply to.
2. University Type, Size, Quality, and Reputation
Every university in Northern California offers a different student experience. The type of experience prospective students receive is entirely up to them. Older universities are generally more research-oriented and offer more traditional courses. You will also find a large cohort of newly graduated high school students at older, more traditional universities. On the other side of the coin, smaller, newer universities are more vocationally oriented, so you will find an older cohort and more part-time students.
Universities also vary in size. One of our neighboring universities, the University of California, Berkeley, has over 42,000 students. That’s a huge number where lectures are given to hundreds of students at a time. Here at San Francisco Bay University, we focus on a smaller cohort of students so that our professors can pay close attention to individual student successes.
Also, consider the quality and reputation of the institution you plan to join. Every university has its own reputation and quality varies from one to another. We are proud to maintain a solid 5-Star rating on Google and several other online listings and review sites.
3. Area of Study
The program you choose will play an important role in the university you choose. At San Francisco Bay University, we offer programs in the following disciplines:
School of Engineering (Computer Science and Electrical)
School of Business (BSBA and MBA)
Intensive English Program 
There is a method behind the disciplines our students have to choose from. Being a Silicon Valley-based university, we feel some of the best job opportunities available to our graduating cohort are right here in our area. And the degrees they can choose from fit right in with what the companies around us require. We also offer an Intensive English Program because we offer generous scholarships and tuition grants and we get a lot of interest from international students whose first language might not be English.
Obviously, there are programs and disciplines that are not present. We don’t have drama or liberal arts programs. Certainly, these are important areas of study, but they may be better suited for other locations and academic institutions. Here at SFBU, we looked closely at students evaluating what a Northern California university might need, and we chose our courses accordingly.
4. University Facilities
Facilities differ by university because they depend on the building and the university utilities. Some universities have huge, old libraries. Others have massive research facilities. Still, you don’t have to impress with advanced facilities. Sometimes an open, clean campus with spacious classrooms, recreation areas, outdoor spaces, and big communal areas is all a student needs. We’ve put together a great virtual tour of our campus, which is big, beautiful, and brand-new.
This is not just an important consideration for what facilities the university has. What facilities they don’t have is also important. Sports might be important to you. If the university you choose does not offer sports facilities or have a sports program, and this is something you want, then a Northern California university just might not be for you!
Also, consider lingering COVID restrictions and impacts on university facilities. For example, here at San Francisco Bay University, we are still unable to offer food services in our diner due to COVID restrictions. Other institutions may be facing the same problem. Fortunately, we have a ton of great dining options within walking distance of our campus.
5. Resources and Support Systems
As a new student, you’re going to have a lot of questions. Look for a university that has your long-term success in mind. You may have housing questions when you arrive, but you may need career advice before you graduate. The university you choose should be able to provide these services to you. Make sure the counselors you work with view and help you as a whole person and not just a student.
Before choosing a university or college in California, make sure the school can accommodate any medical or special learning requirements you may have. When dealing with the homesickness and pressure that comes from attending a university, make sure your university has adequate counseling and health and wellness services.
Writing and tutoring services are generally ubiquitous among institutes of higher education, but you still want to check the quality and availability of those resources. Are they conveniently accessible should you need them? Finally, do they offer comprehensive access to alumni services? You will always be a part of the institution you graduate from. How accessible they remain after graduation matters.
Certainly, there are more considerations. Embarking on a journey of higher education is no small matter. Wherever you choose to get your next degree, keep these tips in mind and you’ll be sure to make the right decision. Think you may want to choose San Francisco Bay University? Call us at 510-803-SFBU.

  Top 3 Networking Tips for New University Graduates






Networking can sometimes feel forced, contrived, or simply transactional. And for newly graduated university students making their way in the world, that can make it awkward or nerve-wracking to meet people and make new connections. New graduates from a top university in San Francisco usually want to find a high-paying tech job right out of school and in many cases, they need help doing it. Fortunately, it isn’t hard to get the help they need with the proper networking methodology. Networking does not need to feel daunting. Building a network to help you on your career journey can be intimidating, but knowing how to approach professionals and build connections is a powerful tool to help you find the perfect career.
According to analytics put together by a LinkedIn research team, in 2020, students from four-year colleges with successful job hunts averaged 114.5 new connections during that full, year-long period. This represented a 17% increase from their connection rate in 2019 when we were living in pre-COVID times. In a remote work environment, graduating students may feel more pressure than ever before to ensure that they find and network with the right people.
Every successful business person or ambitious employee has various beneficial relationships. Not only does it help them find job opportunities or hire industrious and capable people, but it also helps them maintain their success. That’s why we’ve put together a helpful list of five essential networking tips to help students successfully navigate the post-graduation landscape. These are important considerations as students finish their studies and plot their initial career moves.
1. Use Age as an Asset
Right after high school or college graduation, students may have a comparatively undeveloped reputation. And while their youth viewed through the lens of experience may be a liability, it is an asset when viewed through the prism of productivity, motivation, and longevity. Young professionals are eager to show themselves as an asset to the organization. Finding a good job and keeping it can be tough in an unstable world with constantly changing economic conditions. As such, young workers tend to show a high level of motivation and productivity. And graduates from top universities in San Francisco already know the environment in Silicon Valley is tough.
It is also important to remember that people are less understanding later on in one’s career. There will be certain expectations of workers as they mature and gather experience. So it is important that they leverage their moments in youth to network, make friends, and establish relationships. Networking events are beneficial, as are trips to the local coffee shop. One should be outgoing and shouldn’t be afraid to introduce their talents or talk about who they are and what they want to do. Science has proven that it’s harder to make friends and network as you get older. In this case, one shouldn’t let youth be wasted on the young.
2. Make Friends and Establish Bonds
While some may point out differences, it can be said that networking is really nothing more than making friends, establishing bonds, and creating relationships. Whether it is with people in a school, work, or home environment - as one networks effectively, friends are made. For those who have landed a job in their chosen profession but want to make connections, a natural way to network is simply to make friends with co-workers and employees at other companies in their field at various events.
The relationships one makes as they make friends and network can ultimately be more valuable than the relationships made at their job as they climb the ladder. Their peers can be the first ones to think of them when there's a job opening, the ones to help them or give them ideas if they encounter some professional dilemma and they have no idea what to do. Personal and professional peers should be ignored at one’s peril. These relationships can be just as important as any others.
Young people are disproportionately impacted by economic crises. And in many cases, they know. As a result, they have a higher level of awareness when it comes to the relationships they create. The people one invests in can play a big role in the overall trajectory of their life.
3. Take Advantage of Opportunities at Events
It's easy to sign up for networking events for the sake of signing up for networking events. One shouldn’t do a thing simply because one can. Careful thought and consideration must go into post-academic career planning. And events should be a part of that planning. The whole purpose of events, conventions, and meet-ups is to bring people together. Aspiring, recently-graduated career professionals should take full advantage of the opportunities afforded at networking events and other professional get-togethers.
Yet, rather than leveraging these opportunities, many people sign up for an event only to find themselves wandering aimlessly through a deserted networking wilderness. Don’t sign up for networking events willy-nilly. The only events that deserve attention are ones that provide legitimate employment or other career-advancing opportunities. Sign up for events attended by desirable employers that are looking to hire people, especially the newly-graduated. One should focus more of their time on what connections they can build through their existing relationships (friends of friends, friends of parents, family friends, etc.). And here at SFBU, we put a focus on helping our students find and maintain healthy relationships
We are proud to offer an alumni portal that contains links to all sorts of events. One can also find links to the various alumni clubs, such as the Easy English club. We also routinely advertise community events right on the front home page of our website. For more information, contact us today at 510-803-SFBU (7328).

  Tuition and Costs of Attending SFBU: We Break it Down for You






Choosing to attend college or university is no small task. It takes a lot of time, effort, and resources. And, of course, you have to be able to pay for it. Now that you are ready to begin your university journey, it’s time to get ready to pay the bills! Because whether it's you or your parents footing the bill, going to college or attending university requires a certain level of financial responsibility.
At the same time, we don’t want you to worry. Sure, it will be important to budget properly. Maybe you’ll have to forgo that awesome new pair of kicks to ensure your new university bills get paid. Or maybe not! If you create a sound budget and act with fiscal responsibility, there is no reason why you can’t pay for a high-quality education and occasionally splurge on yourself. Whether it be a new pair of shoes or dinner at a nice restaurant, self-care is important. But how will you make it all work?

We’ll also discuss ways to help you better manage your money. We want to help you get through your university experience in a sound financial position.
In the end, don’t let the idea of university costs dissuade you from the incredible opportunities a college education provides. Not only do we offer affordable tuition, but getting a college degree vastly improves your post-college earning potential. A higher education is always worth the cost.
What Are the Base Undergraduate and Graduate Costs to Attend SFBU?

Tuition Assistance and Scholarships for Students
SFBU is proud to offer classes at a lower price point than universities with similar programs. We’re also proud to offer tuition grants for up to 75% of your tuition costs. Our tuition grants offer big savings for students who need assistance paying for school. For example, for a master’s degree without tuition assistance, you would pay an estimated $21,636. With a 75% tuition grant, you can expect to pay around $9,486.
Not only does SFBU offer tuition assistance to those who qualify, we offer scholarships as well. In general, scholarships are awarded based upon various criteria, such as academic merit, diversity and inclusion, athletic skill, and financial need.
While scholarship and tuition grant recipients are not required to repay scholarships or grants, the awards may require that the recipient continue to meet certain requirements while they are in class, such as maintaining a minimum grade point average or engaging in a certain activity. Scholarships may provide a monetary award, an in-kind award, or a combination. Let’s have a closer look at the scholarships SFBU offers. At the end of the section we will provide a link you can use to look at scholarship requirements in greater detail.
Students can apply for a few different types of President’s Scholarships at SFBU. First, students based in California can apply for a President’s Scholarship for California Community College transfer students. The most important aspect of this scholarship is that to take advantage of it, you must have earned an associates degree or obtained a minimum of 60 transferable credits at a California community college. Transferable credits must be counted towards a bachelor’s degree requirement. SFBU offers President’s Scholarships for those seeking a Bachelor’s or Master’s Degree. These scholarships cover 100% of your tuition provided you meet certain requirements.
SFBU also offers scholarships that cover both tuition and housing. These are popular for students who want to both live in campus-provided housing and receive tuition assistance. Housing is limited, so the housing scholarship is contingent on housing availability, but if awarded the student receives housing assistance for a period of two consecutive trimesters and 100% tuition assistance as well.
There are a limited number of scholarships available, so early applications are highly recommended. You remember the old saying, “The early bird gets the worm!” Consider this an accurate axiom when applying for a scholarship. You don’t want to miss out on it simply because you did not apply in time.
Did you know we currently have 62 students benefiting from one of our scholarships? This could certainly be you if you qualify. Right now we have 15 students utilizing the Housing Scholarship, 13 using the President’s Scholarship, and 34 getting 75% of their tuition paid through one of our Tuition Grants. These students are seeing real-world savings. And when you see them walking around campus with that new pair of kicks, you will understand why.
For more information, including the specific requirements associated with each type of scholarship, simply  click or tap here.
Other Costs Associated with Attending a California University
Attending a college or university in Northern California comes with costs outside of what you pay to the university. Sure, you’ve got to cover tuition and housing (if you don’t get a scholarship), but there are other costs that you might not have considered. Many are associated with simply living! From computers to clothes - this is stuff you need regardless.
Consider technology and electronics. Electronics are one of the most expensive and commonly purchased items for college or university students. You don’t want a nice laptop just for that latest video game. You want to quickly and easily get around files and complete assignments. Students can expect to spend $262 on average  on electronics.
We’ve been talking about those shoes, so why not expand on that. Clothes are not cheap and you will need them as you work towards your degree. What’s the breakdown on clothes and shoes? Around $148.37 per month. Obviously, we know San Franciscans are stylish and the city isn’t cheap, so you could probably add another twenty bucks to that.
Transportation will have to be another cost you consider. Especially since there are so may awesome activities in the Bay area! Whether you are a local with a vehicle or come from another country, getting around is important, and the costs associated are necessary expenses. Transportation costs can run up to  $1,200 per year, depending on the modes or method of transportation you use.
Here are some other associated costs or expenses you can expect as a college student:
Food
Utilities
Cell phone and service
As you can see, there are plenty of costs associated with attending a university. At SFBU, our goal is to ensure our students have the resources they need to succeed. There is certainly some measure of financial learning that comes from getting a degree. We are here to help you along your educational and financial journey, however, you need us. Contact us today to learn how your education awaits at San Francisco Bay University!

  Why Should You Study Electrical Engineering?






Deciding what to study at university is never easy. Above all, when deciding on a college or university major, prospective students need to follow their passions. After all, it does you no good to study a topic that you simply aren’t interested in. In fact, according to a recent study, only 46% of college graduates actually work in their field of study. The same respondents were fairly divided regarding their prospects of finding a well-paying job in their field of study. Fortunately, as a premier university in San Francisco, we proudly offer cutting-edge degree programs. And an electrical engineering degree is cutting-edge. Electrical engineering has been around for a long time, at least since 1821, but electrical engineers are still in high demand. It’s an old discipline that’s far from old-fashioned.
So, what makes electrical engineering so great? Well, for one, an electrical engineer works at the forefront of developing new technologies for many industries. From transportation and logistics to healthcare, construction, and robotics - electrical engineers are a required component. Electrical engineers also create and improve systems that provide a net benefit to society. Finally, and this may be the most important factor of all, electrical engineers are in high demand.
It’s important to leverage potential career options against how much money you’ll make and the kind of work you’ll be doing. That's why we wanted to take a deeper dive into electrical engineering. We offer a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering (MSEE) program, but is it right for you? What makes electrical engineering such a desirable area of study and potential career option?
What is the Difference Between Electrical Engineering and Electronic Engineering?
Electricity is an integral part of modern life. It could be argued that the discovery of alternating current and the advent of modern electricity was one of the big societal game changers of all time. Electricity and power generation touch just about every aspect of our lives. Let us count the ways:
Power generation
Transportation and logistics
Healthcare and medical technology
Quantum computing
Artificial intelligence (AI)
Cryptography
Communications
… and more!
Here’s a question everyone asks: What’s the difference between electrical and electronic? To put it simply, electrical engineers work with the supply and flow of electricity. Conversely, electronic engineers create and engineer physical devices that we use in our everyday lives. Electrical engineering specifically touches on the actual harnessing of electricity. This could include producing, delivering, storing, and transmitting power. Take one of our neighbors here at SFBU as an example. Tesla is so close we could bring them cookies. And they need a lot of electrical engineers. The proximity we have to so many world-class companies is one of the upsides of being a university in the San Francisco Bay Area.
Meanwhile, electronic engineering specifically refers to the creating, designing, and testing of electrical circuits and components. Electronic engineering also refers to integrating computer hardware and software systems. All applicable fields apply to electronic engineering, from AI to computation and communications.
We’ve talked about electrical engineering and what it is, but now the question is why should you choose it? Out of all possible options, why should this area of discipline be what you spend your valuable time studying?
1. Money
As much as we hate to say it, money and pay are still primary motivating factors for anyone selecting a major or career. Fortunately, electrical engineers make a healthy living. According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, the reported median salary for electrical engineers in 2021 was $100,420 and for electronic engineers, $104,820.
Electrical engineers currently have a good job outlook, on par with the average for the United States right now. The BLS expects job opportunities to expand by approximately 3% on an annualized basis. This would account for approximately 9,000 new high-paying jobs.
There are even ways to make more than half-a-million dollars per year as an electrical engineer. The key is to learn the attributes of a high-paying engineering job and then properly position yourself within the marketplace.
2. Specialization
Much like other high-tech majors, electrical engineering encompasses a wealth of different job titles. They include, but are not limited to:
Electrical design engineer
Electrical control engineer
Power systems engineer
Circuits engineer
Electrical project engineer
Instrumentation engineer
Photonics specialist
Electrical reliability engineer
And the list doesn’t end there. The fact is, if electricity fascinates you, then a career in electrical engineering might be exactly what you’re looking for.
3. Transferable Skills
Employers look for a diverse array of skills and fresh mindsets. Skills are essential, but innovation comes from new ideas and different ways of working to achieve your goals. Fortunately, the skills and innovative thinking you get from studying electrical engineering are easily transferred to other areas of study and career options.
4. High Demand
There’s a huge benefit to the high demand for electrical engineers: The need is global. There are not only high-paying electrical engineering jobs open all over the world, there are a lot of them. Even in today’s remote work environment, electrical engineers are traveling to where their jobs are. You’ll be hard pressed to find electrical engineers that are wont for work. From smartphones to medical devices and security systems, electrical engineers design it all.
5. It’s Never Boring
New electrical devices and components, whether for consumer or commercial applications, are invented and created every single day. When high-tech devices go to market, companies backing these devices are already looking for the next big thing. Companies build upon ideas and improve and innovate on current technologies every day. And many of them, especially those that serve universities in San Francisco, provide opportunities for their employees to be a part of the next big thing in technology and electrical engineering.
If you are even remotely interested in electrical engineering as a discipline for study in university, consider San Francisco Bay University. We are proud to be a university in San Francisco dedicated to cutting-edge degree programs. And we are even more proud to offer generous scholarships, grants, and tuition assistance to help students who want to get a degree in electrical engineering. Enroll today and future-proof your degree decision!

  5 Best Day Trips in the Bay Area






The San Francisco Bay Area has so much to offer that people could spend a week here and still find new things to explore and do. Yet, there are also fantastic day trip options within spitting distance of San Francisco and the universities in Fremont, California. We’ve covered a lot of ground when it comes to Bay Area activities. Everything from our favorite outdoor activities to our recommended options for students taking their parents out on the town - we’ve introduced you to lots of options. Now we want to spread our wings a little and take you outside the Bay Area to surrounding cities and towns because some of Northern California’s best offerings don’t necessarily lie within city limits. The question is: where to?
Sure, everyone knows about Sausalito day trips, but what else is out there? Fortunately, a lot. So much that we even discovered new things as we researched this article. That’s why it was so difficult to choose only five. So, how did we do it? Well, we took into consideration everything from the sights to sounds, culture, adventure, traveler sentiment, variety, and local insight. It wasn’t an easy list to put together, but we think we’ve managed it. Are you ready to venture out of Fremont and see what the wider area around the San Francisco Bay Area has to offer? Let’s dive right in!
1. California’s Great America
While Southern California likes to lay claim to the title of “Theme Park Capital of California,” Northern California is no slouch. Enter California’s Great America, a theme park in Santa Clara. It’s about a 1 hour and 45-minute drive from Fremont but head out early so you have time to navigate the lines. California’s Great America has some awesome rides like the Gold Striker, a giant wooden roller coaster. It’s also got a whitewater rafting ride and a single-rail steel roller coaster. There’s a food court, souvenirs, and merchandise for those who are visiting from outside California.
Attached to California’s Great America is the Boomerang Bay Water Park, which is open during the summer season and is a great place for students or visiting families to splash around during the hot summer months. The maze of slides and tubes will leave you cooled off and smiling in delight, no matter your age bracket. Finally, there’s Planet Snoopy and Kidzville, which is another separate amusement area for young kids. Live stage productions are held all day long. From September through October, Great America holds its Halloween Haunt, which has haunted houses, costumed actors, and scares of all shapes and sizes. Are you ready to leave the confines of the universities in Fremont and embrace your inner child? If so, head on over to California’s Great America for the day!
2. Napa Valley
We’re taking you to the exact opposite side of the equation now. If spending your day at an adventure theme park isn’t something that excites you, consider something much more adult. Enter Napa Valley. It doesn’t get much more adult than one of the premier wine destinations not just in California, but the world. SFBU students and visitors should consider themselves lucky to have access to such a high-demand destination.
For day trippers, the best way to get a full feel of Napa Valley will be on the Napa Valley Wine Train, which travels to nearby St. Helena and back, snaking through scenic hills and vineyards along the way. It’s a gorgeous and quick way to get a feel for Napa Valley without the need to stay overnight. In the end, one should raise their expectations. Napa Valley grants travelers access to 400-plus wineries, the Calistoga hot springs and mineral pools, and a handful of Michelin-starred establishments. Whether you are into wine, food, or scenic views, Napa Valley is a true treat for anyone who wants to day trip out from SFBU or another university in Fremont and explore some of the best Northern California has to offer.
BONUS TIP: While this category is meant to highlight Napa Valley, we want to provide a more inexpensive and family-friendly option: Sonoma! About 45 miles north of San Francisco, Sonoma also boasts dozens of wineries and exclusive eateries but also offers Safari Park West and the nearby Sonoma Coast State Park.
3. Filoli Estate & Gardens
Just 25 miles south of San Francisco, the Filoli Estate & Gardens encompasses nearly 700 acres of wild parkland, 16 immaculately landscaped gardens, and a historical mansion with several rooms open to the public. Filoli was built 10 years after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and was seen at the time of its building as a symbol of hope amid the ruin. Its stunningly beautiful English Renaissance gardens are considered by many to be among some of the best English garden replicas in the United States.
And it’s these gardens that hold the charm the Estate is known for. Beautiful flowers, gigantic trees, and perfectly manicured gardens lie behind huge shrubbery stands. Even better, the gardens constantly change based on the season, so true anthophiles will find reasons to visit multiple times throughout the year. If the size of the grounds and mansion seems imposing, consider a 1-hour guided tour. The estate often hosts special events as well, so be sure to visit their website for more information.
While the gardens and grounds steal the show, the mansion itself is quite special. From the flower-covered portico to a grand marble foyer and huge ballroom, it’s a building that will take you back in time. Make note of the massive vaulted ceilings that run the length of one of the house’s wings and are 174 feet long. There’s also a reception room and a formal dining room that has 20 seats and two marble fireplaces. So, for a relaxing day trip that will transport you from the urban Fremont center to the 19th Century, head to Filoli Estate & Gardens!
4. Armstrong Redwoods State Natural Reserve
Even though we are a university in Fremont, California, surrounded by dense urban jungle and Silicon Valley heavyweights, there is a different kind of jungle - forest, if you will - that we want to take you to. If you haven’t noticed by now, as an avid follower of the SFBU Blog, we love the great outdoors. We love nature and activities that get you out and into the wild, whether that be in the woods, up in the mountains, or lounging on the beach. And what better way to have a uniquely Northern California day-trip than by visiting the redwoods!
Naturally, most people are familiar with Redwoods National Park, but we wanted to take you somewhere different to give you a two-for-one. Just under two hours from Fremont, Armstrong Redwoods State Natural Reserve is an ancient Redwood grove that feels as wild as it does timeless. Well-manicured trails snake through over 800 acres of coastal redwood lands. And these redwoods, quite literally, stand out. Some are more than 350 feet tall and over 2,000 years old. The Parson Jones tree is the largest tree in the grove and is taller than the length of a football field. It’s huge! And no matter what you have in mind for your day trip, a nice picnic, a calm hike, or something more strenuous, Armstrong State Natural Reserve has it all. Now, what’s the two-for-one we mentioned?
BONUS TIP: Located in Central Sonoma County, the town of Guerneville lies just a stone’s throw from the Armstrong Redwoods State Natural Reserve. It has long been a weekend getaway and summer vacation spot for San Franciscans. But if you get out early enough, you can make a full day-trip out of visiting the town and the park. The town has tons of charm and its riverside location adds an extra touch of beauty and serenity. If you’re going to visit the redwoods at Armstrong State Natural Reserve, well, you may as well add Guerneville into the mix for a full day of natural and man-made merriment.
5. USS Hornet Museum
As we made our way through various outdoor options, charming little towns, and amusement parks, we came across a day-trip activity that stood out for its uniqueness. A tour of the USS Hornet aircraft carrier! It’s highly unlikely that - unless you’ve served in the U.S. Navy - you have ever been on or seen the inside of an aircraft carrier. These things are basically floating cities and a tour of the USS Hornet is probably as close as you’ll ever get to wander around one.
Approximately one hour away from universities in Fremont, the USS Hornet is parked at the pier in Alameda, California. Despite its sleek and high-tech look, it was built in 1942 and played a significant role in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. Perhaps most interestingly, it was also used to pick up and transport the Apollo astronauts as they returned home from the moon. After a short 10-minute history and safety video, visitors are free to roam about the vessel, with volunteers stationed throughout in case you have any questions or get lost. With tons (and we mean that literally) of passageways, compartments, and desks to explore, there’s no doubt you’ll easily spend your full day enjoying this unique experience.
Well, there you have it! It wasn’t easy for us to choose these five day trips out of the many options we have. But we hope that SFBU students or anyone else stumbling upon these options find them fun and enjoyable. Whether you are day-tripping out from SFBU, a premier university in Fremont, California, or somewhere else in the Bay Area - safe travels!

  Application Series: How to Apply to SFBU’s Undergraduate Program






After completing high school, many young people find themselves at a crossroads. With a job market as hot as the one we have today, there are plenty of options. Employers added nearly half-a-million workers at the end of 2021 alone, and 2022 is shaping up to be another gangbusters year for those seeking employment. So, what’s a student to do once they graduate? Well, one thing they could do is apply to an undergraduate computer science program in California. Why? Because California is home to the highest cluster of hi-tech companies in the world.
Research shows that getting a college degree vastly improves your chances of landing the job you want and increases your money-making potential. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, getting a degree increases your median usual weekly earnings. That’s why most students, upon completing high school, consider pursuing a college degree. And completing your undergraduate degree not only helps you land a great job and increase your earning potential, it also helps you build a strong educational foundation, improve your technical skills, and prepare you for the career of your dreams. Still, you need to make sure the undergraduate degree you choose is right for you and learn what it entails.
What is an Undergraduate Degree and What Does it Require?
An undergraduate degree is a bachelor’s degree. They are one and the same. An undergraduate degree is a credential you receive when you complete a course of study at a college or university. Here at San Francisco Bay University, we offer undergraduate degrees in the following disciplines:
Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA)
Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS)
If you are considering a college degree, you might be thinking about getting a graduate degree. Undergraduate and graduate degrees both offer key credentials but have distinct requirements and outcomes. Undergraduate programs usually require students to complete high school and take college entrance exams like the SAT or the ACT exam. They may also require personal essays, reference letters, and interviews.
Most bachelor's degree programs are designed to take students four years to complete. Undergraduate students usually take dozens of courses that cover their main area of study and provide basic education in areas like math, science, language, and culture. Requirements may vary depending on the degree.
To earn an undergraduate degree, students must complete the required courses and ensure they achieve a minimum grade point average. Once an undergraduate degree has been obtained, students will generally be qualified for entry- or mid-level careers of their choice, or they can move on to apply for graduate programs. As we mentioned before, earning a bachelor’s degree can qualify you for jobs in many industries and greatly increase your earning potential. But before a prospective student can even apply for an undergraduate degree, they must complete the steps required to be accepted.
How to Apply to the SFBU Undergraduate Program
Here at SFBU, our goal is to assist new students in embarking on their journey to obtain a bachelor’s degree in a discipline of their choosing. We assist through every step of the process, whether it be explaining admission requirements or even just learning more about the institution. We also accept students from community colleges interested in obtaining a four-year degree.

  What Makes California Universities and Colleges So Special?






California has long been a place where individuals come to attain a first-class higher education. While much of the history of the United States is interwoven into the fabric of East Coast Ivy League universities, the spirit of the wild west endures in California universities and colleges. San Francisco Bay University is proud to uphold this tradition.
California is a popular destination for high school students from Asian countries especially. It’s just a quick hop across the Pacific Ocean and before you know it you find yourself studying at a high-caliber institution.
Still, California did not just become a hot spot of academic excellence overnight. It took hundreds of years of development, from the good old days to modern times, for cities in California to become hotbeds of innovation and culture. California is a melting pot, and as such, the diverse array of individuals, companies, and organizations make this a fantastic place to learn.
With a GDP of  $2.8 trillion, California would slot between Germany and the United Kingdom in the world's top economies, and by itself makes up for 14% of the US economy. It is, without a doubt, a major economic growth engine of the United States. Obviously, Germany and the U.K. are both very desirable places for students looking to get a degree, and here is California, right there among them. It is this level of excellence and sheer grandiosity of California that seeps into the colleges and universities that dot the state.
Northern California From Then to Now
One of the key reasons why Northern California is such a powerhouse of innovation and investment is that there is a culture of collaboration, even between groups that could be seen as competitors. If you live in Northern California or San Francisco, you understand why our culture fosters innovation.
We don’t like to do something the “traditional” way. We pride ourselves on being forward thinkers and innovators. In the area around Silicon Valley, Berkeley, and the San Francisco Bay, there is an eagerness to be first, whether it be the first to try a new experience, the first to buy from a new company or to test a new piece of technology.
People here in the San Francisco Bay Area love new ideas. And they are not shy about bringing them up in conversation. It isn’t a matter of arrogance, but more of confidence and inquisitiveness. The schools, businesses, and governments of Northern California foster an environment of participation and contribution. They live by the idea that you should bring something to teach and be prepared to learn.
Yet, this wasn’t always the case. The history of innovation in the Bay Area took a long time to write and went through a series of convulsions. The Bay Area’s progressive spirit was a shock to many in the 80s. And throughout the decades, it has been this progressive spirit that has defined the culture of Northern California.
The Evolution of Northern California as a Culture and Technological Powerhouse
The 80s in California was a time for makers. Whether it be unique clothes, posters, or furniture, it was in San Francisco where the West Coast punk scene thrived. Then, by the mid-90s, the worlds of technology and design began to collide. Computers were still novel items, certainly not in every home, and we were transitioning from the pager to the cell phone, now smartphone. It was a technology company right here in neighboring Cupertino that led the charge in combining the best of cutting-edge technology and spectacular, eye-catching design. And it is to this day that Apple, Inc. serves as a top destination for computer science majors, computer engineers, MBA students, and more.
Forward-thinking companies in Silicon Valley spent the 90s and early-2000s immersed in technology, software, mass-manufacturing and user-experience. Whether it be in hardware or software, the behemoths of the tech world integrated the best principles of design and technology. And they did so with the help of students who graduated from Northern California universities and colleges.
Now, here we are in 2022 and the world has changed. We work in a highly technological society. As such, students who want good paying jobs that will last should study disciplines that will prepare them for a cutting-edge future.
Today, students who graduate with a Masters in Computer Science from SFBU can not only gain a glimpse into, but directly affect, how design and technology shape our world today. The multicultural and multidisciplinary approach to creating change is everywhere, both at SFBU and other colleges and universities in the California system.
Here at SFBU, we are proud to be one of many California colleges and universities offering a first class education. Yet, we stand apart. We focus on providing an education on par with the best universities and colleges in the United States, but we offer it at affordable prices.
California Universities and Colleges Share Top Rankings
All you have to do is have a look at any one of  Money’s Best Colleges and Universities  rankings to see that institutions of higher education in California dominate the list. University of California San Diego ranks as one of the best public colleges in the United States. Further north, in our neighborhood, is San Jose State University, which ranks as one of the most transformative colleges. The fact is, just about any list of top colleges and universities has a host of California schools within it.
Have a look at this list of top universities in the United States created by Forbes publishing. Four of the top ten in this list are universities in California, several of which we have listed below.
Here at San Francisco Bay University, we are proud to share the stage here in Northern California with other prestigious colleges and universities, from:
Stanford University
University of California, San Francisco
University of California, Berkeley
San Francisco State University
University of San Francisco
Aside from world-class surfing, dining, and entertainment, California offers a culture of innovation, inspiration, and healthy competitive energy. It is here, in our state, that society is pushed to its best future. At San Francisco Bay University, we are proud to be a part of that story. We offer a top-level education to students from here in California and around the world in the following disciplines:
The Bachelor of Science in Computer Science
Master of Science in Electrical Engineering
Master of Science in Computer Science
Bachelor of Science in Business Administration
Master of Business Administration
Intensive English Program
We even offer tuition assistance and scholarships  for students who need assistance covering their programs. Contact us today at 510-803-SFBU to find out how you can become part of the California innovation legend, no matter where in the world you are from.

  SFBU Now Offers Class Online






San Francisco Bay University is now proud to offer classes online! Similar to attending a physical campus and learning in person, there are specific pros and cons to learning within a virtual classroom setting. But online learning is here to stay. Companies must reskill to meet the demands of a modern and remote workforce. In fact, according to the Future of Jobs Report 2020, 84% percent of employers are set to rapidly digitalize working processes, including a significant expansion of remote work—with the potential to move 44% of their workforce to operate remotely. With so many people working remotely, online education in its many forms is here to stay. And like many other universities in San Francisco, California, we are glad to bring online classes to our student body.
What Classes Does SFBU Offer Online?
It is important that you evaluate the pros and cons of online learning before you make your choice. Students should feel comfortable in the knowledge that what is covered in an in-person class is also covered in an online course. There is no appreciable difference between a degree earned in person and one earned online. If you are intrigued by the possibilities online learning opens up, consider the classes offered by San Francisco Bay University. Universities in San Francisco, California are held to a higher standard. You can expect the same level of rigorous learning and top-notch professors online as you have come to expect in person.
Most of the degree programs we offer here at SFBU are offered in the online modality. That includes:
Bachelor’s in Science Business Administration (BSBA) 
Master of Business Administration (MBA) 
Master of Science in Computer Science (MSCS) 
Intensive English Program (IEP) 
It is important for students to schedule a session with our admissions office to verify that they meet all the eligibility requirements for online classes. While all classes in the online approved degree programs are available in theory, SFBU only offers a specific set of classes during each trimester, so not all classes are available at all times. A quick discussion with one of our admissions counselors will determine which classes are available for online learning and when.
Why Are Online Classes Important?
Among some of the many benefits of online learning, students who take classes online enjoy the more flexible nature of online learning. Taking online classes allows students who want to start working right away to develop their careers right alongside their education. The increased flexibility that comes with a lack of a commute is tangible. And students attending universities in San Francisco, California know traffic can be a real nightmare. The time saved not having to drive to school is significant.
Online classes also save students both time and money. First, if a student travels from another location to campus, they are losing time in the commute. Online classes allow students to log into their classes without the hassle of a long commute. Second, online classes save students money. According to data updated August, 2021, students who commute to a college or university in San Francisco, California - or beyond - pay on average $3,400 a year in transportation costs.
Still, online learning may not be for everyone. It certainly requires a dedicated mindset. Staying on-task and being self-motivated are both critical factors to ensuring you not only succeed but excel in your online classes. And the added flexibility that comes with online learning can be a double-edged sword without proper discipline. It’s important for students to carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages of online learning before they make the decision to switch to virtual classes.
What Are the Benefits of Online Learning?
We already talked about the benefits of flexible learning, but let’s dive a little deeper into that topic. Virtual classrooms are great for people who are working and going to school. When attending virtual classes, students have a lot more autonomy in their schedule by cutting out the commute and saving time on in-person requirements. When you have more control over your schedule, it becomes easier to avoid distractions.
Keeping a flexible learning schedule provides you with more free time. The extra time you gain from taking classes online can be used any way you want, whether it be for more time studying, focusing on your career, or spending more time with your family. When all you need is an internet connection and a laptop or tablet, more effective learning can be found right at your fingertips.
Another important distinction in online learning is the increased levels of collaboration students are exposed to. When students have more flexibility, they have more time for virtual group work sessions and meetings. Most universities in San Francisco, California, and other states, offer message boards and grouping tools for their students. This allows the online student body to post feedback on their readings and assignments and respond to and interact with other classmates and teachers.
Online learning allows for more personalized education. Teachers who teach classes online also have more free time. Students benefit from teachers who can spend more time with them. Students who aren’t as assertive might find more opportunities to participate in class when they are not collaborating with people in an in-person environment. Professors also have more time to spend one-on-one with students, addressing their specific needs.
Are you ready to start your journey through higher education in an online learning environment? Let SFBU guide you through the process and determine whether virtual learning is right for you! And in the meantime, to help your decision, check out our piece evaluating the pros and cons of eLearning.

  The Student's Guide: Opportunities After Graduating from San Francisco Bay University






We would like to think San Francisco Bay University graduates have a ton of opportunities available to them upon graduation. Not only are we in a prime location, surrounded by tech companies of all varieties, but we have the resources, services, and networking opportunities only a place like a university in the San Francisco Bay Area can deliver. Even more, we put a laserlike focus on programs that we think will provide SFBU graduates the chance to land the job of their dreams. Computer science is an example. According to government statistics, the employment of computer and information research scientists is expected to grow by 22% from 2020 to 2030. And that’s why we offer a top-notch Bay Area computer science program.
But it does not stop there. We also offer a degree program with a focus on electrical engineering. While the job outlook for electrical engineers is not as explosive as it is for computer science majors, the demand for electrical engineers is not projected to drop anytime soon. From 2020 to 2030, the overall employment outlook for electronics engineers is projected to grow by 7%. And with the number of engineering graduates growing at a rate of 1.44% between 2018 and 2019, there simply will not be enough graduates to fill the need. Jobs will be plentiful and SFBU electrical engineering graduates will benefit.
Prospective SFBU students can also study business administration and go for their MBA. While some have said the market for MBA graduates is saturated, consider that the percentage of companies hiring MBAs has not dropped. In fact, it has stayed relatively steady since 2017. Let’s look at the data:
2017: 70%
2018: 67%
2019: 76%
2020: 80%
As you can see, the market for MBA graduates has remained relatively steady over the last half-decade. The need for well-rounded graduates in the national and international business world has not dropped. We’re proud to know the future is bright not just for Bay Area computer science program graduates, but for MBA graduates as well. Now, let’s look at each category.
Bay Area Computer Science Programs Are in Hot Demand
There is a reason why Bay Area computer science programs are in such high demand. Just consider for a moment that California’s tech industry employed more than one million professionals in 2021. That represents 10% of California’s entire workforce. Not only that, but California consistently offers some of the highest wages and benefits for tech positions out of any state, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data.
Computer science graduates also have a wealth of career opportunities to choose from, including, but not limited to:
Software Developers
Software Engineers
Computer Systems Analysts
Information Systems Managers
Cybersecurity Analysts
Game Designers
UX Designers
Web Designers
Web Developers
Machine Learning Engineers
Forensic Computer Analysts
… and many more!
Quite frankly, the list goes on. As the future becomes more technologically advanced, fields like nanotechnology, quantum computing, and engineering will become even more important. As 5G cellular technology matures and evolves into whatever comes next, network engineers and telecommunications researchers will be in higher demand.
And don’t worry about graduating without work experience. There are opportunities for Bay Area computer science program graduates. Whether it be in the form of IT-related work placements, internships, or shadowing opportunities, typically once you show your mettle, the company you’re working with will bring you on full-time.
It may also be useful to develop a personal portfolio of computer science-related projects, whether they involve programming, website development, or even online moderation. If you can show initiative by fixing bugs, improving functionality, or even building a useful application, companies will find you highly desirable.
How to Make a Degree in Electrical Engineering Work for You
As we mentioned before, the need for electrical engineers in the workplace is not diminishing. Obtaining a degree in electrical engineering is not a bad idea for those interested. Consider that according to the latest LinkedIn recruiting data, there are over 71,000 graduate electrical engineering jobs currently open in the United States. Companies simply cannot fill these positions fast enough. Graduates with electrical engineering degrees can choose from careers in a wide range of engineering industries. And that’s the beauty of obtaining an electrical engineering degree from SFBU. You could use it for just about any discipline. Here are some examples of jobs you could potentially go for with a degree in electrical engineering:
Aerospace Engineers
CAD Technicians
Broadcast Engineers
Nuclear Engineers
Special Effects Technicians
Machine Learning Engineers
Technical Sales Engineers
Land-Based Engineers
… and many more!
The beauty of engineering degrees is that you typically can gain hands-on experience and practical understanding of specialized industries with an electrical engineering degree alone. Companies will generally hire you knowing you have the skillset on a broader level, then train you to be a specialist wherever they need you.
When you join companies in this fashion, you will generally work alongside other engineers from other disciplines, but your role will be to provide electrical engineering expertise. However, depending on your skill level and the company you sign on with, you may develop into a more “generalist” engineer. You may wind up picking up knowledge from other areas and studying multiple disciplines, which only increases your value to the company.
Opportunities That Lie in Obtaining your MBA
Economic changes have led to an increase in the quality and quantity of job opportunities for MBA graduates. Because of historically low unemployment rates, MBA graduates have a high level of negotiation power when looking for the perfect job. The fact is everyone today is more valuable than they were even a few years ago. Companies are paying higher salaries and looking for more graduates. The median starting salary for MBA hires is around $115,000 per year, which certainly is nothing to shake a stick at.
Like Bay Area computer science programs and electrical engineering graduates, MBA graduates have a wide array of jobs to choose from upon graduation. Some examples include:
Business Consultants
Accounting Consultants
Investment Bankers
Logistics Managers
Healthcare Managers
Marketing Managers
Business Operation Specialists
Sales Managers
Financial Managers
… and many more!
What is great about an MBA is that you can replace the word “manager” in the aforementioned examples with the word “director” or even “vice president” depending on your experience and skill level. The number of employment opportunities for MBA graduates and the need for managers and directors only increases by the year.
MBA professors here at SFBU urge our business school graduates to use their marketable skills to look for job opportunities in the area of business analytics, change management, supply chain management (in hot demand during today’s supply chain crisis), and project management. These are the types of MBA-related positions in high demand in our local area.
Graduates should consider what their initial dream job would be and then adapt their job search to fit their desires. An MBA is such a versatile degree that graduates really have more choice than graduates from just about any other discipline. And it is also a reason why so many prospective students choose to obtain an MBA over other degree options.
At SFBU, we proudly offer scholarships, grants, and tuition assistance for students from the United States and abroad in whatever area of study they are interested in. We have chosen these fields of study because of our specialized location and the unique need for graduates in these disciplines. Want to learn more about the potential opportunities available to you as a student at San Francisco Bay University? Simply get in touch with our admissions office and we’ll be happy to answer all your questions.

  Why an MSCS Computer Science Degree is Right for You






Let’s face it, the ROI you get from obtaining an MSCS computer science degree is undeniable. MSCS graduates are instantly qualified to step into high-paying, high-demand computer science careers. Graduates can then move on to specialty areas of the field such as artificial intelligence, biomechanics, robotics, cybersecurity, and coding.
Computer science graduates also have high earning potential upon graduation. With a base salary of $89,000 per year, it isn’t long before computer science graduates are making six figures. And when Forbes ranked graduate degrees by a salary increase, the M.S. in Computer Science came in second. Still, is this the career for you?
Computer science graduates understand that this is a discipline that is best learned by doing. Students must get down into the coding trenches and learn the ins and outs of today’s most advanced technology. It may seem difficult. And because of this, some professionals with a bachelor’s question whether a master’s in computer science is worth it. Are you asking yourself, “Should I get an MSCS computer science degree?” Let’s look at the pros and cons.
Benefits of an MSCS Computer Science Degree
While a bachelor’s in computer science will serve you well, you need more than basic knowledge about computers and their applications. You still need a lot of advanced and practical knowledge. A Master’s degree represents a good way to gain expert knowledge. An MSCS will also open up a lot of job opportunities. You can secure your financial future by working for companies that are in the Fremont area.
Advanced computer knowledge is required for a significant number of in-demand jobs. From scientists to technical experts, IT workers, data analysts, machine learning specialists, cybersecurity experts, and more. These industries and disciplines rely on advanced computer knowledge. And companies that operate within these industries are willing to pay well and offer handsome benefits to computer science graduates.
In addition to great pay, companies looking for computer science graduates offer long-term job security, and continuous uptraining. And opportunities are only growing. The job outlook for computer science graduates from 2021-2031, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is 21%, or much faster than average. According to current data, this rate is faster than the average of many other occupations.
Technology is Always Changing
Technological advancements require quite a bit of lead time and research. Computer technology is constantly growing, changing, evolving, and expanding into society. Take data collection as just one example. The increasing need for data collection requires the hiring of more data scientists. Just consider that the world now generates an estimated 2.5 quintillion bytes of data every day. Where does the data go? How do you collate and mine it? These are questions data scientists ponder every day. It’s exciting stuff!
Computer and research scientists are highly sought today because of the interdependency on technological advancements and inventions. Interoperability between systems has become a hot topic as disparate systems join each other in the cloud. And as they join each other in the cloud, cybersecurity is more important than ever.
Many MSCS computer science graduates will go on to work in network and cloud security. Cyberattacks have become quite common and software engineers and analysts are required to devise ways to minimize and mitigate the damage from these threats. In fact, many computer scientists are involved in creating entirely new programming languages for this purpose.
Should You Apply for a Master’s in Computer Science Program?
This is an appropriate question no matter what you study. “Should I study [insert discipline here]” is a question asked by just about every student. There are certainly arguments to be made on either side of an MSCS degree. Certainly, you have already done the work on a bachelor’s degree. But what it really comes down to, as with almost everything else, is you. Here are some questions to consider:
What are your goals?
Where do you see yourself in the next five to ten years?
Do you have the time (and money) to devote to school?
Does your employer expect you to get an advanced degree?
You, and only you, can determine if a computer science master’s degree is worth it.
As you finalize your decision, take some time to learn more about what an MSCS computer science degree will do for you. Here are some questions to consider as you make this evaluation:
Where can you take classes?
Are you a good candidate to pursue a master’s in computer science?
How do you want to use the degree?
What is the cost of the degree?
What are your future salary expectations?
Considering these factors will put you on the right path to the right decision.
What Can You Expect from a Master’s in Computer Science Degree Program in the US?
Before you can decide to do a thing, you must know about it. Obviously, if you’ve already studied for your bachelor’s, then you have a pretty good idea of what to expect. In short, a master’s in computer science, or MSCS degree, is a graduate degree that provides current computer scientists and engineers with the opportunity to expand their knowledge base and gain a more sophisticated understanding of development, troubleshooting, and advanced principles. MSCS in computer science programs cover topics like computer language theory, advanced software development, advanced algorithms, quantum computing, machine learning, and more.
Ultimately, what you study will depend on your previous education and career focus up to this point. Some CS master’s programs waive basic courses for students who have completed similar coursework during their undergraduate studies. Additional courses depend on your concentration and post-graduate goals. Be prepared to complete a master’s thesis and a capstone project to complete your degree.
At San Francisco Bay University, the Master of Science in Computer Science degree program prepares students for the complexities of advanced software engineering and internet applications. Students acquire knowledge of advanced design, development, deployment, and integration principles. Once they graduate, SFBU students gain access to some of the most exclusive high-tech companies in the area. And with generous scholarship options, consider SFBU as you study for your MSCS in computer science!

  Why Should You Get a Scholarship for an MBA in the USA?






At San Francisco Bay University, we believe in providing a high-quality education at prices students can afford. But what’s better than an affordable education? A near-free education! That’s why we’re proud to offer an array of scholarships designed to help students worldwide get a first-class education in the United States. Right here in the San Francisco Bay area, as a matter of fact. Whether you are looking for a scholarship for an MBA in the USA or another discipline, SFBU wants to help you realize your academic dreams. We are proud to have students from the United States, India, Nigeria, and many other parts of the world studying SFBU programs and being awarded scholarships.
It’s a fact that in most countries, pursuing higher education can be an expensive endeavor. Whether it be tuition fees, housing, living expenses, or otherwise - getting an education is not easy. And although university fees can be expensive, students can get help. Let’s take a closer look at why scholarships are so important.
1. Scholarships Make Education More Accessible
According to a study in U.S. News & World Report, the average cost for bachelor’s, master's, and doctoral degrees has risen by 134% since 2002. These eye-popping numbers certainly have a discouraging effect on students, no matter where in the world they are. For students in developing countries, tuition in the tens of thousands of dollars puts a degree firmly out of reach. All this is during a time when business-related degree programs are more popular than ever. There is a reason why students look for scholarships for MBA programs in the USA more than any other program. Regardless of their area of study, securing financial aid through a scholarship opens the door to opportunities that they wouldn’t otherwise have.
Scholarships also allow students to be more selective about their degree programs. It reduces their risk of dropping out and provides opportunities for them to expand their academic experience, whether it be through internships or study abroad programs.
2. Support Through an Expanded Network
Many universities, including SFBU, offer students who are awarded a scholarship for an MBA in the USA other types of financial support. Not only do students gain access to scholarship funds, but they are generally guided by an admissions specialist to ensure they make the best use of their funds. For first-year students from foreign countries like Nepal or Ghana, mentorship from a qualified professional can be a huge help. Expert advice isn’t always available when one doesn’t know where to look. That’s where qualified mentors can help. Being on the receiving end of a scholarship opens the door to other resource opportunities one may not have considered before.
Networking can seem intimidating in a foreign country. Attending a foreign university and interacting with new types of people should be viewed as a net positive, however. Getting a scholarship to a U.S.-based university allows you to attend school-related events and activities. Expanding your network increases both personal and professional development and spurs growth.
3. Scholarships Provide Greater Flexibility and Opportunity
Many students do not actually want to work while they go to college or university and would prefer to focus on their studies. Yet many students find themselves taking on employment of some sort to help cover the cost of tuition and other expenses. Even at a part-time job, 15 hours of work a week can be quite disruptive to studies. This is where a scholarship comes in. Financial assistance allows students to dedicate more of their time to their studies and less to work. They are less tired, less stressed, and more productive in school and other endeavors.
Scholarships also, in and of themselves, create more opportunities for the recipients. They boost one’s resume simply by being on it. Business leaders all over the world view scholarships as prestigious awards. They demonstrate outstanding merit on behalf of the student and elevate their academic and professional profile.
Are MBAs Still Important?
We’ve talked about scholarships, but let’s get to the other half of this title, and that’s the MBA or Masters in Business Administration degree. There’s been a lot of chatter in the past few years that, as universities churned out MBA graduates, the degree’s usefulness became diluted. Back in 2014, the MBA was the most popular master’s degree program in the United States, but some may now question its value. Well, worry not. The MBA has staying power, and its cachet is far from being spent.
In fact, MBAs are still considered one of the most prestigious degrees, both in the United States and abroad. MBA degree programs in the USA are as varied as the academic institutions that offer them. It is important that students applying for MBA scholarships in the USA pick a proper specialization, but they also need to decide whether they will get their degree through distance learning. Here at SFBU, we are proud to offer our classes online (as well as in a more traditional in-person setting). This is what has made us such an appealing choice for students from around the world.
Just consider for a moment the rapid advancement in technology and manufacturing. Global businesses require more effective management techniques, paradigm-shifting strategies, and future-proofed business practices. The fact is that business management exists on the same level as medicine or the law. Skilled management professionals keep the gears of commerce turning.
The Early MBA
Although business management exists alongside medicine and law today, that wasn’t always the case. The concept was not well received in the 20th century. It wasn’t until the mid-20th century that industrialization kicked into full gear and business managers became ubiquitous. Specific business standards and labor laws were implemented to govern the use of sophisticated machinery. As manual labor changed, the way businesses were managed also needed to change.
As new businesses and advanced manufacturing evolved, executive boards across the country - and the world - began looking for ways to create more effective management techniques. Managing a company well became something more akin to a science than an art. Industry managers of all types needed to find ways to address divisions of specialization, labor tasks, and workflow hierarchy. And it would be the colleges and universities that answered the call to teach these business owners and managers best practices in running an efficient business. While the first known business school was established in 1819 in Paris, by the mid-20th century universities and colleges were teaching business and offering MBA scholarships in the USA for local and foreign students.
Today, the core MBA curriculum includes accounting, business strategy, economics, finance, and manufacturing and production. And yet, many universities have expanded on those core competencies to include:
Operations Management
Globalization
Health Tech
Marketing and Advertising
Social Enterprise
MBAs have gone through a varied evolution since the first business school was created over 200 years ago. Today, they are still considered to be a valuable degree that imparts a diverse set of skills to those who earn one. And scholarships represent a great opportunity for students who may not have the funds up-front to receive a quality education. If you are a foreign student curious about obtaining a scholarship for an MBA in the USA, we’d like to propose Northern California. SFBU offers competitive programs and generous scholarships, tuition assistance, and grants. Now is the time for an MBA from a prestigious university in the Bay Area. Our phone number is +1-510-803-SFBU.

Intensive English Program (IEP)








An Accredited Program to Improve English Language Skills
The Intensive English Program at SFBU is  accredited  by The Commission on English Language Program Accreditation.








Program Structure
San Francisco Bay University’s IEP features four levels of courses in Grammar, Listening and Speaking, Writing, and Reading. With 7.5-week courses meeting for five hours a week, each course has a total of 37.5 hours. These student-centered classes have a maximum of 15 students, so students can build their communication skills in an interactive small group setting.
The IEP’s academic affairs are managed by the Chief Academic Officer, ESL Administrator, and IEP faculty members.
Purpose
The IEP is open to non-native speakers of English who want to improve their English language skills quickly. This program is designed for students preparing for university study, working professionals, and learners who want to increase their ability to communicate in English in general.
Mission
The Intensive English Program supports San Francisco Bay University’s mission by equipping non-native speakers with the English language skills needed to successfully advance towards their academic and career goals. Along with providing an orientation to academic culture in the U.S. and fostering a diverse international community, the IEP helps students overcome the linguistic difficulties involved in studying a subject in English in a university setting.
Intensive English Program Objectives
Students will develop fluency and accuracy in both spoken and written English.
Students will develop effective oral communication strategies to interpret auditory input and express concrete and abstract ideas, in formal as well as informal settings, and with increasingly native-like pronunciation.
Students will demonstrate comprehension of a variety of texts of increasing complexity, evaluate texts using critical reading skills, and identify useful and reliable sources when doing research.
Students will write sentences, paragraphs, and essays using connecting expressions and developing ideas with supporting evidence; follow the conventions of standard paragraph and essay format; and synthesize and cite information from various sources.
Students will accurately use grammatical structures of greater complexity as well as employ vocabulary of increasing variety and precision.

IEP Academic Calendar




SFBU is proud to offer an Intensive English Program for students who want to learn English quickly and effectively. With its location in the San Francisco Bay Area, an international hub, SFBU attracts many skilled and talented students from abroad who have grown up speaking a language other than English. SFBU’s Intensive English Program helps those students develop and refine their English skills so that they can gain a broad and universal skill set that will allow them to excel in a career in the Bay Area or beyond.
SFBU runs Intensive English Program courses for English language learners in 7.5-week sessions held six times per year. All courses meet for five hours each week, meaning there is a total of 37.5 hours of instruction for the entire course. Students enrolled full-time in four courses engage in 20 hours per week of instructional time.

Applying to the IEP




Admission Requirements
IEP students must be at least 18 years old by the first day of class.
Students must have a proficiency level higher than a true beginner in the English language to be accepted into the IEP. Elementary Level is the upper elementary, or CEFR A2, level. Elementary Level is within IELTS band 4, and it equates approximately to a TOEFL iBT score of 31 and a TOEFL Essentials band score of 3.5.
Online IEP students must have regular access to an electronic device with audio and video capabilities, and a reliable internet connection. 
Application

International students who will be on F-1 visas should read Process for International Students before applying. International students with sponsors must have sponsors complete a Guarantor Letter. This letter should be signed by hand; electronic signatures are not acceptable.

Apply Here
Orientation, Placement Test, Enrollment, and Registration
New IEP students must attend the New Student Orientation before the first day of the IEP session. During or before the orientation, students will take a placement test to identify their level of English proficiency. Students will be placed into a level based on their results. The placement test is free and takes about one hour to complete. The placement test may be waived if the student provides an original copy of a TOEFL or IELTS test report form which is not more than two years old.
The ESL Administrator meets with each IEP student after level placement to finish enrollment and course registration. Tuition and the $75 registration fee are due at that time.

  When do we Use an Apostrophe + s ('s)?


 
 
 
Use 's at the end of a word when you want to do one of these things:
 
1. Use the short form of is. Instead of “Godzilla is angry,” you can write “Godzilla’s angry.” The apostrophe shows that the letter i is missing.
Note: this use is informal; do not use 's in this way in formal writing.
 

 
2. Use the short form of has when has is the helping verb in a present perfect verb construction. Instead of “Godzilla has just destroyed a bridge,” you can write “Godzilla’s just destroyed a bridge.” The apostrophe shows that the letters h and a are missing.
Note: this use is also informal; do not use 's in this way in formal writing.
 
 

 
3. Write the short form of us in the construction “let’s” when you are making a suggestion. “Let us” is very formal and we don’t say or write it now, but we write the apostrophe in “let’s” to show that the letter u of the old form “let us” is missing. For example, “Let’s watch a Godzilla movie tonight!”
 
4. Show possession (ownership). Instead of “Godzilla pulled down the electric lines of Tokyo,” you can write “Godzilla pulled down Tokyo’s electric lines.” The electric lines belong to Tokyo.
Note: do not use 's to show possession with personal pronouns (I, you, he, she, it, we, they). Personal pronouns have their own possessive forms: my, your, his, her, its, our, their.
 

 

it’s = it is, for example “It’s really scary when Godzilla comes to town.”


it’s = it has, for example “It’s been fun watching a Godzilla movie.”
its = something belongs to it, for example “When Godzilla left, Tokyo was dark. Its electric lines were destroyed.”
 

Do NOT use 's when you want to do one of these things:
 
1. Make a noun plural (more than one). Write “Godzilla has destroyed many subway trains,” not “Godzilla has destroyed many subway train’s.”
 

 
2. Write a third person singular (he/she/it) verb. Write “Godzilla lives in the sea,” not “Godzilla live’s in the sea.”

  Understanding and Being Understood - Part 3


 
 
If possible, ask the person to write the word.
 
For example, you hear “My life is a catastrophe.”
 
You understand part of what is being said, my life is a, but you don't recognize the last word.
You ask the person to use different words, but the word she chooses, “disaster”, does not help you understand.
You don't know the word “disaster.” 
Then she says “train wreck”, but you don't know the word "wreck" or how her life could be a train.
 
If possible, ask the person to write the word. 
 
This is helpful for two reasons:
 
If you speak a European language, you probably have the word catastrophe in your language, 
but it may sound very different. If you see the word catastrophe, you might recognize it from your language, though
you could not recognize it by hearing it pronounced in English. 
This is true for many words.
You understand now!
 
You may know a word in English because you have read it before and you understand the
meaning, but you have never heard anyone say the word. You think you know how it should be
pronounced, because you know how to spell it. But remember that English spelling and
pronunciation are often very different. When someone says a word that you know from reading
it, but you have never heard it, you may not recognize it. You will recognize it when you see it.
You understand now!

  Understanding and Being Understood - Part 1


 
 
You are speaking with someone and she says something, but you don’t understand part of it.
 
For example, you hear “Now I feel like xxxxxx.”
 
You say “Could you please repeat that?” or “I’m sorry, what did you say?”
Then you hear “I said, now I feel like xxxxxx.”
You say “I’m sorry; could you please say that again, slowly?”
You hear “I–s-ai-d, n-ow—I—f-ee-l—l-i-ke—x-x-x-x-x-x.”
 
You still don’t understand the end of the sentence. What can you do?
 
If you understand part of a sentence or question, it is not a good idea to ask the person to repeat all of it.
The other person does not know which part you are having trouble with, and will probably say the same thing in the same way, again.
It is better to repeat the part that you understand, and ask a question about the part that you don’t understand:
 
“I’m sorry; now you feel like what?” 
 
This tells the other person that she should say the part of the sentence after like more slowly and clearly.
 
You hear “Like I am ready to go.”
 
You understand now!

  Understanding and Being Understood - Part 2


 
 
You understand the words, but you still don't know what the person means.
 
For example, you hear “Like my back is against the wall.”
 
You understand the words, but you don't understand the meaning. The speaker is sitting in a chair across the table from you, not standing against the wall.
 
You can explain, “I'm sorry, but I don't understand what that means”
Then you can ask, “Could you please use different words?" or
 
“Could you please explain what you mean?” 
 
She then explains to you, "I don't have a choice any more. I have to deal with the situation."
 
You understand now!

Structure of the Intensive English Program



The IEP teaches practical English skills for general, academic, and professional purposes. Based on the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR), the four levels of the IEP range from upper elementary to advanced. Elementary and Lower Intermediate Levels concentrate on General English, while Upper Intermediate and Advanced Levels focus on English for Academic Purposes (EAP).
Elementary and Lower Intermediate Levels
In Elementary and Lower Intermediate Levels, students concentrate on developing fundamental English skills in an interactive classroom setting. Coursework emphasizes skills necessary for effective oral and written communication. Instruction covers all areas of language development: vocabulary, basic language structures, and the essentials of reading, writing, listening and speaking, and grammar.
Upper Intermediate and Advanced Levels
In Upper Intermediate and Advanced Levels, students continue to develop fluency and accuracy. Coursework focuses on both comprehensive skills and English for Academic Purposes (EAP). This includes writing essays and research papers as well as developing critical reading, listening, and note-taking skills.
 
Each level has 4 courses (Listening & Speaking, Reading, Writing, and Grammar), and each course consists of 5 hours of classroom instruction per week, making a total of 20 hours per week for full-time study.
 
Online Course Option
All IEP courses can be offered on campus or online via synchronous livestreaming.
Please note: International students with F-1 immigration status may enroll only in on-campus IEP courses.

Speaker Series: Transitioning from College to a Career












 


Date

Sat, Aug 6, 2022, 1:30pm  - 2:45pm 



Location
Classroom 210 (Lecture Hall) , 161 Mission Falls Lane, Fremont, California 94539 & Zoom





Join San Francisco Bay University’s Summer 2022 Speaker Series with our featured speaker, Ashley Weerpass presenting “Transitioning from College to a Career”.


Presentation Summary:
Our lives are filled with goals, decisions, plans, and execution. You made an excellent decision to invest in yourself and your future by going to and completing college. College while difficult is simple since often once a field is chosen the curriculum and pace are well defined. Choosing a career and navigating 30 to 40 years of gainful employment is less straightforward. Today’s graduates find themselves navigating a myriad of options. Our world is a global village and opportunities exist in more than one country. Income can be derived from a variety of means, self-employment, employee, gig-worker, and hybrid work.
Key ongoing questions are:
What job is best for me?
What are my strengths?
What is my life plan for each phase of my life?
What will make me happy? Is success equal to happiness?
Speaker: Ashley Weerpass
Ashley Weerpass has an extensive background in Technical Business Management. He has worked with Multi-National and Fortune 500 companies for over thirty-five years. He has worked in the United States and abroad, leading technical teams to achieve significant business results. He continues to coach, mentor, and teach others to increase their skills and achieve their life goals. He has an Engineering Undergraduate degree and a Master’s in Business Administration. His background includes business strategy development, sales, project management, and management of for-profit businesses. He now works with non-profit organizations to help build strategy and plans for mission success.

8 Key Tech Trends in Post COVID-19 World












 


Date

Tue, Feb 23, 2021, 8:00am  - 9:00am 



Location
Webinar - online




The COVID-19 pandemic is the ultimate catalyst for digital transformation and will greatly accelerate several major trends that were already well underway before the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic will have a lasting effect not only on our economy, but on how we go about our daily lives, and things are not likely to return to pre-pandemic norms. While this pandemic has forced many businesses to reduce or suspend operations, affecting their bottom line, it has helped to accelerate the development of several emerging technologies. This is especially true for innovations that reduce human-to-human contact, automate processes, and increase productivity amid social distancing.  
Speaker: Prof. Ahmed Banafa
No. 1 Tech Voice to Follow & Influencer on LikedIn. Award Winning Author.
Expert: IoT-Blockchain-Cybersecurity | Keynote Speaker
Tuesday, February 23rd at 8AM PST.  Don't miss out!

Join us to keep up with the ever-changing world of technology!

Student Spotlight: Afrin Patni




 


 
Afrin Patni
Master of Business Administration program
 

Afrin Patni is following her American dream.
Originally from Mumbai, India, Patni is studying at San Francisco Bay University to pursue a career in technology. While she knows her bachelor’s degrees in sociology and education aren’t traditional for the field, she is working on her master's in business administration at SFBU to help her jump into the industry.
“It was my dream to come here and study in America,” Patni said.
The university’s location is one of the main reasons Patni enrolled. Its proximity to San Francisco, Silicon Valley and companies such as Google, Zoom and Tesla was enticing to her. She also loves the mountain views, weather and hiking that she didn’t experience in India.
Patni credits her stellar education to SFBU’s small class sizes and personal relationships with teachers. She receives not only advice on her studies and career path, but for her personal life, as well.
“SFBU is not just about textbooks and lectures, it is preparing us for our future,” Patni said. “It's working on our soft skills. I know that when I graduate from SFBU, I'll get good opportunities where I can apply my skills and excel in my career to achieve great things.”
The university understands the importance of a proper work-life balance. There are clubs like Toastmasters International to improve one’s public speaking and leadership prowess, but there are also video game consoles ready to provide relief from stress. Outside of class, Patni can be found playing ping pong and board games.
Above all, Patni is proud to be a part of the SFBU community.
“This place feels like home, and I know that I have a bright future.”

Avery Niou graduated from San Francisco Bay University with her Master of Science in Computer Science (MSCS) this past spring. Avery is multilingual: she speaks Mandarin, Taiwanese, English, and a bit of Japanese.
 
Avery was born and raised in Taiwan, but relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area two years ago. When speaking of the greatest challenge she has overcome thus far, Avery said, “I left my comfort zone where I grew up and a company I worked for six years. I decided to move to Silicon Valley without any family or friends, to pursue my dreams.”
 
When a friend of Avery’s landed a great position at a Silicon Valley company after earning a degree from San Francisco Bay University, she knew she would pursue her master's degree in Computer Science at SFBU. When asked what she enjoyed most about her experience while attending SFBU, Avery stated, “SFBU is a job hunting-oriented learning environment; new courses are constantly added to the curriculum based on the job market and current industry trends.”
 
Avery started her journey at SFBU with a passion for front-end software development, but hadn't yet obtained the knowledge and skills needed for the workforce. While taking a Computer Science course with Dr. Ken Cheung, JavaScript and Internet Programming, Avery's knowledge grew in this subject, pushing her further towards her goal of becoming a software engineer: “The projects from this course taught me so much. I was able to add them to my resume.” Other subjects that Avery studied during her time at SFBU include big data, cloud computing, and machine learning.
 
After earning her degree at San Francisco Bay University, Avery landed a job at PlayStation as a software engineer. When asked her definition of success, Avery stated, “I think success happens often, every time you achieve a small goal that is a success. Little successes accumulate to your life story.” Avery’s future goals include becoming a senior software engineer, exploring her passion further for front-end development, and enhancing her DevOps skills.
 
Congratulations and best wishes to Avery! Thank you for sharing your story with the San Francisco Bay University community.

Student Spotlight: John Odebode




 


 
John Odebode
Master of Business Administration program

This is San Francisco Bay University student John Odebode. John has just completed his final trimester at SFBU, and will be graduating with his Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree at the upcoming ceremony happening in May.
Having grown up in Nigeria, John pursued a Bachelor’s and Master's degree in Philosophy at the University of Lagos, and later landed a job in Supply Chain with ExxonMobil. His six years of experience in the field motivated him to pursue an MBA, which landed him at San Francisco Bay University.
"It took me securing a graduate internship at ExxonMobil in 2016 to have a sense of direction on where exactly I was headed. I had the opportunity to work in the procurement department at ExxonMobil, Nigeria, which opened me up to a world of possibilities in the business space. Ever since then, I picked up interest in supply chain management–that has been the lane for me."
Although he misses them dearly, John's parents, three brothers, and one sister, who reside in Nigeria, continue to support his aspirations of pursuing education and a career. Apart from his academic and professional pursuits, John likes to play soccer and actively participates in a local league in Santa Clara.
In his search for an MBA program that aligned with his specific goals, John found SFBU to be an ideal choice due to its curriculum. Furthermore, he was fortunate enough to receive a scholarship to support his studies. John also recognized the benefits of the smaller class sizes at SFBU, as they allowed him to build closer relationships with his professors and customize his education to suit his unique experiences and career aspirations. Small classes create a more personalized learning experience. John noted that “There’s a lot of innovation happening in this environment, and the prospect of being a part of it was a deciding factor in why I chose SFBU.”
What John likes most about SFBU is “the people! The professors and staff members have a sincere interest in my success, and I speak for all students when I say there is a sense of commitment for professors and staff to contribute positively to our lives and support our dreams.”
When asked about his proudest moment, John said, “I’ve had a lot, and there will be more to come, but I’ve had the privilege to connect with many prospective students and see them transition to current SFBU students reporting to campus. It gives me a lot of joy knowing that I helped them through their decision-making process.”
The Capstone Project holds a special place in John's mind, as it is designed to encapsulate all the knowledge he has gained in the MBA program thus far, and utilize it to create a comprehensive business plan. John’s project was a business plan for Maestro 360, a sports management company.
For John, the best part about going to school here is “the diversity of the environment: there are people from all walks of life, ethnic groups, and cultures, and it has been a great experience connecting with all these people. I’ve learned so much about other cultures and perspectives on life.”
As a participant in SFBU's Curricular Practical Training (CPT) program, John had the opportunity to intern while studying. He secured an internship with Cummins Inc. through CPT and was determined to excel in his role, striving to meet and exceed his manager's expectations while balancing his academic workload. This experience taught John the value of time management and to maximize his productivity. His hard work paid off, and he was eventually offered a full-time position at the end of his internship. John will return to Cummins Inc. in June in the role of Value Package Introduction (VPI) Integrator, Technical Sourcing, and Cost Management. John explains, “The value I have gotten from SFBU is beyond paying them to provide a service. I have gotten much more than what I have paid for.”
When asked about the individuals who have had an impact on his life, several people come to John's mind. His father's strong sense of responsibility has played a significant role in shaping him into the person he is today. Moreover, Mr. Dele-Ijagbulu Folu, his manager at ExxonMobil, has been a major influence on John's career, inspiring him to pursue a career in supply chain management. Folu's exemplary leadership qualities have left a lasting impression on John, to the extent that he would wake up on Monday mornings looking forward to working with him. Additionally, at SFBU, Executive Vice President Paul Choi's work ethic and drive have influenced John's approach to his career.
John believes that success is "making the most of the moment and giving the very best to everything you do. It’s a journey, never a destination."
John’s advice to current and prospective students is this:


"There is more to SFBU than what you get in class and what you have been asked to do by your professors, so take advantage of every opportunity SFBU has to offer you!"


Congratulations and best wishes, John, throughout your next journey and beyond. Thank you for being such an inspiration to the San Francisco Bay University community!

Student Spotlight: Julio Camacho




 


 
Julio Camacho
Master of Business Administration program

This is San Francisco Bay University student Julio Camacho. Julio is a 2022 President's Scholarship recipient working towards his Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree and is just starting his journey at SFBU this trimester (Fall 2022).
Julio was born and raised in Guadalajara, Mexico, where he earned his B.A. in International Relations. Growing up, Julio was not drawn to jobs most kids wanted, such as working as a police officer or a firefighter. Instead, he was interested in careers such as architecture and graphic design. While earning his B.A. degree, Julio had the opportunity to study abroad temporarily in Santiago, Chile. He loved his time there so much that he decided to move back to Santiago after graduating to get more professional experience. Then, he began to focus on becoming a private sector development expert through business strategies that can help strengthen small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and foster local entrepreneurship through innovation and data-driven approaches.
Julio describes himself as a passionate person who is curious by nature, likes to be around people who can teach him things, and appreciates learning different points of view. With many experiences under his belt, Julio often follows his heart and likes to take risks. His greatest challenge to date has been moving to the U.S. to pursue his MBA at San Francisco Bay University. While adjusting to life in San Francisco, he has realized that there are many cultural differences between the U.S. and Mexico, and he sometimes misses his family and friends. In fact, it was never in his plans to study in the U.S. Julio explains, “When the opportunity came to my door, I was scared but curious, and I thought, ‘What if I can make it? Maybe there is a chance for me here.’ There were doubts, but here I am! It’s been challenging, but it’s a great opportunity.”


“What if I can make it? Maybe there is a chance for me here.” 


Julio lives in San Francisco and commutes to SFBU by BART. He likes to use his commute time to study and catch up on reading, which is one of his favorite hobbies: “I like reading novels by Mexican and Latin authors that address social issues and real things happening in this world. Hurricane Season by Fernanda Melchor is a book he recommends for everyone to read in order to understand one of the many issues of contemporary Mexico. Julio explains, “It captures the level of violence and machismo culture through the lens of people who are suffering injustices such as inequality, poverty, and corruption. It is a novel that has really stuck with me.”
When asked about his proudest moment, Julio had two in mind. The first was receiving the President’s Scholarship from SFBU. He had never received a scholarship before, and was honored by the opportunity provided by SFBU. The second was a professional moment while working as a project analyst at a Mexican startup last year. Julio worked on finding grants and entering startup competitions to help the company grow; his efforts helped the company to receive grants from different organizations: SingularityU Mexico, Google for Startups, and AT&T Mexico.
San Francisco Bay University was recommended to Julio by his partner, who also recommended California State University, Northridge. Julio ultimately decided on SFBU because he was drawn to San Francisco: it is one of the world's most innovative, enterprising, and diverse cities; it is walkable; and the Bay Area has good public transportation. Lastly, he chose SFBU because he received the President’s Scholarship.
While attending San Francisco Bay University, Julio is looking forward to gaining knowledge and work experience, which he will compare to his work experience in Mexico. Julio is interested in learning more about the startup environment in San Francisco and will focus on finding an internship there while studying.
When asked what he enjoys most about SFBU so far, Julio said, “I really like the diverse community and how the students are from all different parts of the world, and I think that is the most interesting part… the sharing of experiences and perspectives is very rich.” In addition, Julio also likes the small classroom size because it is easier to get to know his classmates and professors: “The best part is sharing conversations with classmates about different foods and the current political state in our home countries. There's always something new and always something to learn from one another.”


“There's always something new and always something to learn from one another.” 


After graduating from San Francisco Bay University, Julio would like to gain work experience in the U.S. because that would be extremely valuable when he returns to Mexico. He wants to pursue his dream career as a private sector development consultant, and help small and medium businesses in Mexico become more innovative and competitive.
In addition to his studies, Julio enjoys traveling, reading, listening to music and podcasts, cooking healthy foods and desserts, and biking. He even spent the New Year in Brazil with friends! When asked what he likes best about the Bay Area, Julio said, “It's very diverse; not a day goes by where I don’t hear a foreign accent and Spanish, for example. There are great things to do: museums, libraries, and food experiences.”
Julio shared that an English teacher he had in Mexico greatly influenced him on a personal level: “He had an interesting perspective on life, and planted the seed that made me want to leave Mexico to explore and have this international experience. He influenced me to keep studying and earn an MBA. He introduced me to the music I listen to, and the political and social issues we talked about influenced me, as well. We still keep in touch.”
Julio advises current and prospective SFBU students to “come with an open mind and embrace the opportunity. Get out of your comfort zone, because this is what this experience is all about! Broaden your horizons, meet new people, have an opportunistic attitude, and learn something. Be curious, ask questions, and go deeper into topics. To question and see different perspectives is part of the learning process.”


“To question and see different perspectives is part of the learning process.” 


Congratulations and best wishes, Julio, throughout your journey at SFBU and beyond. Thank you for being such an inspiration to the San Francisco Bay University community!

SFBU Policies




 




Non-discrimination Policy


San Francisco Bay University (SFBU), in accordance with applicable Federal and State law and University policy, does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national, and/or ethnic origin, sex, marital status, gender identity, sexual orientation, pregnancy*, physical or mental disability, medical condition (cancer related or genetic characteristics), ancestry, religion, service in the uniformed services** , or age. SFBU also prohibits unlawful harassment including sexual harassment and sexual violence. This policy of non-discrimination applies to all aspects of admission, education, employment, financial aid, student activities, and other school-administered programs. SFBU is obligated to investigate all discrimination complaints, including harassment in an unbiased, thorough manner.
 
Anyone with questions about SFBU’s non-discrimination policy or complaints is encouraged to contact the Legal Team at compliance@sfbu.edu.
* Pregnancy includes pregnancy, childbirth, and medical conditions related to pregnancy or childbirth.
** Service in the uniformed services includes membership, application for membership, the performance of service, application for service, or obligation for service in the uniformed services.
 



Student Grievance Policy and Procedure
 



SFBU takes grievances regarding the institution seriously. Students have the right to file a grievance that concerns SFBU, whether such grievances are with personnel, the course of study, general university policies, or other related matters. This policy describes the grievance procedure available to students.
1) INFORMAL RESOLUTION
SFBU highly encourages students to attempt to informally resolve concerns directly with the aggrieving party or department. Students are particularly encouraged to informally resolve academic matters, such as those involving course policies, with their instructor, or, if their instructor is not available, with their respective dean, prior to filing a grievance. Grade appeals may be made as described in the section of this catalog entitled “Grading Policy and Academic Standards.”
Even after initiating the formal grievance process, students are encouraged to seek informal resolution of their concerns. A student whose concerns are resolved may withdraw a formal grievance at any point in the process.
With regard to appeals of disciplinary action and all other grievances, including those related to harassment and discrimination, no student is obligated to attempt informal resolution and may bring a formal grievance to the administration as outlined in this policy.
2) TIMING
Academic grievances and appeals of disciplinary action must be received by the administration within 30 days of the close of the academic term in which the first incident giving rise to the grievance occurred or the notice date of the disciplinary action.
There is no deadline for other types of complaints.

 
3) GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE AND RESOLUTION
All grievances and supporting documentation shall be submitted in writing to the SFBU Compliance Department. The grievance should be made using the SFBU Grievance Form, which is available on the SFBU website.
Please note that if a grievance is being filed in order to appeal disciplinary action, the grievance must include a description of the basis of appeal. Failure to state the basis of the appeal in the initial grievance may result in denial of the appeal. The following are the only valid bases of appeal:
new evidence which could reasonably be expected to cause the individual(s) reviewing the grievance to overrule prior disciplinary action,
failure to follow published SFBU policies in a way that materially disadvantaged the student;
demonstrated bias or discrimination and (iv) the sanction imposed is substantially disproportionate to the severity of the violation.
The grievance may be sent via email to compliance@sfbu.edu or delivered in person to the front desk of the SFBU Administrative Building during normal business hours. If the grievance is regarding SFBU Compliance or its personnel, then the grievance may be sent to the Executive Vice President via in person delivery to the front desk of the SFBU Administrative Building during normal business hours. In such case, complainant should specify that the grievance is regarding compliance or its personnel. Intake personnel, generally a member of SFBU Compliance, will review the form. If the form is complete, intake personnel will, within 5 business days of receipt, acknowledge receipt of the grievance and forward it to the appropriate party for review and resolution. Matters are generally forwarded as follows:
Academic matters are forwarded to the Chief Academic Officer, or the Chief Academic Officer’s designee.
Appeals of disciplinary action are forwarded to the Executive Vice President, or the Executive Vice President’s designee.
All other complaints are assigned to a member of SFBU Compliance.
Depending upon the type and complexity of the grievance, the appropriate party may, in their discretion, adjudicate the matter or assign the matter to a Grievance committee.
Within 60 days of receipt of the grievance, SFBU shall provide a written response to the grievance via email. If further investigation is needed, the complainant will be provided with a written response to the grievance within 10 business days after completion of the investigation.
The complainant may appeal SFBU’s resolution by filing a statement of appeal that clearly describes the basis of appeal within 5 business days of the date of the written response. The President of SFBU, or the President’s designee, shall adjudicate the appeal within 30 days of SFBU’s receipt of complainant’s statement of appeal.
If a complainant has exhausted all grievance procedures provided under SFBU’s policies, the complainant may contact:
The WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC), 1080 Marina Village Parkway, Suite 500, Alameda, CA 94501, 510.748.9001.
4) NO RETALIATION
No member of the SFBU community shall be subject to adverse action by SFBU based upon the reasonable good faith filing or participation in a grievance.
5) MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS
Records for student complaints are maintained for at least 6 years. Records for grievances made by non-students are maintained in accordance with applicable university policy.
 



Reasonable Accommodation for Students with Disabilities
 



SFBU adheres to the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements and provides reasonable accommodations for students who are otherwise qualified but have disabilities. Such disabilities may include learning disabilities, health impairments and other documented conditions.
Students who wish to discuss the availability of services for people with physical disabilities or temporary disabilities, or who wish to report barrier problems, should contact the Director of Counseling and Career Services.
 



Academic Freedom Policy



Academic freedom includes, but is not necessarily limited to, the right to free inquiry, expression, and discussion. Faculty are members of a learned profession and stewards of this educational institution. When they speak or write as citizens, they should be free from institutional censorship or discipline. As educators, they should remember that the public may judge their profession and their institution by their utterances. SFBU will not retaliate against faculty members for sharing their convictions and responsible conclusions with their colleagues and students in their teaching and writing; however, faculty should not incorporate controversial matter that has no relation to their subject into their teaching. Faculty members are not authorized to engage in offensive speech such as hate speech or sexual harassment.
 



Credit Hour Policy



SFBU follows federal guidelines regarding credit hours.
Pursuant to 34 C.F.R. §600.2, a credit hour is an amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that is an institutionally established equivalency that reasonably approximates not less than –
1) One hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out-of-class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester or trimester hour of credit, or ten to twelve weeks for one-quarter hour of credit, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or
2) At least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph (1) of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institution including laboratory work, internships, practica, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours.
The above shall apply to both in-person and distance education modalities. 
One hour of classroom = One contact hour
One contact hour = 50 minutes of instruction
 



Transfer of Credit from Other Institutions



Undergraduate Transfer Credit
Course credit earned at other institutions of higher education may be transferable. Credit transfer is made by the admission evaluators while conducting the admission evaluation or by formal transfer agreement between institutions. The transfer of credit is done at the program-of-study level, topic area level, the major and major selectable levels and on a case-by-case basis. The following statements apply to all transfer credits:
The SFBU Admissions Office must receive all official transcripts prior to the student’s joining a degree program. Without preapproval, transcripts received after the student joins SFBU cannot be used in transferring credits, except for records from the term immediately preceding the student’s starting trimester at SFBU. Up to 75 units of courses that have been reviewed and currently approved as part of a formal SFBU articulation/transfer agreement are guaranteed to transfer.
The student was officially enrolled in the course.
Courses eligible for transfer by prearranged transfer / articulation agreement shall follow the details contained in the agreement. Courses eligible for one-to-one matching course transfer will be evaluated based on the comparability in content, quality and rigor with SFBU’s courses. Required courses require a closer comparability match. Courses eligible for topic area transfer may be mapped to the program's relevant topic area unit requirements without the need for one-to-one course matching and may have their units used to lieu of required units with the approval of the Registrar and School Dean. The transfer evaluation will include, but is not limited to, course descriptions, course syllabi, and/or general public information. Students may be asked to provide course catalogs or syllabi if needed. Up to 75 trimester units of courses that have been reviewed and currently approved as part of a formal SFBU articulation/transfer agreement are guaranteed to transfer.
When evaluating any foreign transcript, the admission evaluators may accept or transfer credit based on their knowledge of the course contents in comparison with similar courses offered in the U.S.
Without prior approval courses for transfer to SFBU may not be completed concurrently at another institution while a student is matriculated in an SFBU degree program.
College English courses taken at an institution where English is not an official language cannot be transferred for general education credit.
The credits under consideration for transfer must be earned at (1) institutions approved by the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education, (2) public or private institutions of higher learning accredited by an accrediting association recognized by the U. S. Department of Education, or (3) foreign institutions of higher learning. Credits earned at a foreign institution degree must be evaluated by a member of National Association of Credential Evaluation Services (NACES), Association of International Credential Evaluators (AICE), or American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO)’s International Education Services.
Professional Development Units (PDUs) offered by professional/industry organizations cannot be transferred to SFBU for academic credit.
Continuing Education Units (CEUs) offered on a non-academic basis by other academic institutions cannot be transferred to SFBU for academic credit.
The total credits transferred from other institutions to meet the student’s undergraduate program requirements are limited to 75 trimester units. Students must take at least 45 units at SFBU.
Credits transferred at the time of admission evaluation will reduce program length. Credit transferred from any outside institution has no effect on the calculation of the student’s GPA or CGPA.
Credits transferred from any outside institution are excluded from the maximum attempted units for the program.
Credits are transferred by the following conversion:
Definition of a Trimester Unit:
One trimester credit hour equals, at a minimum, 15 contact classroom hours of lecture, 30 contact hours of laboratory, or 45 contact hours of practicum.

Conversion Factor:
1 quarter unit = 0.66 trimester unit

Grades Required for Transfer Credit
In the bachelor's degree programs, applicable courses completed with an equivalency of a letter grade of "C" or better are transferable. ​Courses completed with Pass/No Pass are not transferable unless the transcript states that the general grading policy is not based on letter grades.

Graduate Transfer Credit
Graduate course credit earned at other accredited higher education institutions may be transferable to meet the student’s graduation requirements if the courses are closely related to the engineering course requirements in the student’s intended program of study and the grade earned meets the requirement stated below. Such course credits are considered qualified transfer credits. Credit transfer is made by the admission evaluators while conducting the admission evaluation.
The following statements apply to qualified transfer credits:

SFBU also prohibits unlawful harassment including sexual harassment and sexual violence. This policy of non-discrimination applies to all aspects of admission, education, employment, financial aid, student activities, and other school-administered programs.

Student Grievance Policy and Procedure
 



SFBU takes grievances regarding the institution seriously. Students have the right to file a grievance that concerns SFBU, whether such grievances are with personnel, the course of study, general university policies, or other related matters. This policy describes the grievance procedure available to students.
1) INFORMAL RESOLUTION
SFBU highly encourages students to attempt to informally resolve concerns directly with the aggrieving party or department. Students are particularly encouraged to informally resolve academic matters, such as those involving course policies, with their instructor, or, if their instructor is not available, with their respective dean, prior to filing a grievance. Grade appeals may be made as described in the section of this catalog entitled “Grading Policy and Academic Standards.”
Even after initiating the formal grievance process, students are encouraged to seek informal resolution of their concerns. A student whose concerns are resolved may withdraw a formal grievance at any point in the process.
With regard to appeals of disciplinary action and all other grievances, including those related to harassment and discrimination, no student is obligated to attempt informal resolution and may bring a formal grievance to the administration as outlined in this policy.
2) TIMING
Academic grievances and appeals of disciplinary action must be received by the administration within 30 days of the close of the academic term in which the first incident giving rise to the grievance occurred or the notice date of the disciplinary action.
There is no deadline for other types of complaints.

 
3) GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE AND RESOLUTION
All grievances and supporting documentation shall be submitted in writing to the SFBU Compliance Department. The grievance should be made using the SFBU Grievance Form, which is available on the SFBU website.
Please note that if a grievance is being filed in order to appeal disciplinary action, the grievance must include a description of the basis of appeal. Failure to state the basis of the appeal in the initial grievance may result in denial of the appeal. The following are the only valid bases of appeal:
new evidence which could reasonably be expected to cause the individual(s) reviewing the grievance to overrule prior disciplinary action,
failure to follow published SFBU policies in a way that materially disadvantaged the student;
demonstrated bias or discrimination and (iv) the sanction imposed is substantially disproportionate to the severity of the violation.
The grievance may be sent via email to compliance@sfbu.edu or delivered in person to the front desk of the SFBU Administrative Building during normal business hours. If the grievance is regarding SFBU Compliance or its personnel, then the grievance may be sent to the Executive Vice President via in person delivery to the front desk of the SFBU Administrative Building during normal business hours. In such case, complainant should specify that the grievance is regarding compliance or its personnel. Intake personnel, generally a member of SFBU Compliance, will review the form. If the form is complete, intake personnel will, within 5 business days of receipt, acknowledge receipt of the grievance and forward it to the appropriate party for review and resolution. Matters are generally forwarded as follows:
Academic matters are forwarded to the Chief Academic Officer, or the Chief Academic Officer’s designee.
Appeals of disciplinary action are forwarded to the Executive Vice President, or the Executive Vice President’s designee.
All other complaints are assigned to a member of SFBU Compliance.
Depending upon the type and complexity of the grievance, the appropriate party may, in their discretion, adjudicate the matter or assign the matter to a Grievance committee.
Within 60 days of receipt of the grievance, SFBU shall provide a written response to the grievance via email. If further investigation is needed, the complainant will be provided with a written response to the grievance within 10 business days after completion of the investigation.
The complainant may appeal SFBU’s resolution by filing a statement of appeal that clearly describes the basis of appeal within 5 business days of the date of the written response. The President of SFBU, or the President’s designee, shall adjudicate the appeal within 30 days of SFBU’s receipt of complainant’s statement of appeal.
If a complainant has exhausted all grievance procedures provided under SFBU’s policies, the complainant may contact:
The WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC), 1080 Marina Village Parkway, Suite 500, Alameda, CA 94501, 510.748.9001.
4) NO RETALIATION
No member of the SFBU community shall be subject to adverse action by SFBU based upon the reasonable good faith filing or participation in a grievance.
5) MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS
Records for student complaints are maintained for at least 6 years. Records for grievances made by non-students are maintained in accordance with applicable university policy.
 



Reasonable Accommodation for Students with Disabilities
 



SFBU adheres to the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements and provides reasonable accommodations for students who are otherwise qualified but have disabilities. Such disabilities may include learning disabilities, health impairments and other documented conditions.
Students who wish to discuss the availability of services for people with physical disabilities or temporary disabilities, or who wish to report barrier problems, should contact the Director of Counseling and Career Services.
 



Academic Freedom Policy



Academic freedom includes, but is not necessarily limited to, the right to free inquiry, expression, and discussion. Faculty are members of a learned profession and stewards of this educational institution. When they speak or write as citizens, they should be free from institutional censorship or discipline. As educators, they should remember that the public may judge their profession and their institution by their utterances. SFBU will not retaliate against faculty members for sharing their convictions and responsible conclusions with their colleagues and students in their teaching and writing; however, faculty should not incorporate controversial matter that has no relation to their subject into their teaching. Faculty members are not authorized to engage in offensive speech such as hate speech or sexual harassment.
 



Credit Hour Policy



SFBU follows federal guidelines regarding credit hours.
Pursuant to 34 C.F.R. §600.2, a credit hour is an amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that is an institutionally established equivalency that reasonably approximates not less than –
1) One hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out-of-class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester or trimester hour of credit, or ten to twelve weeks for one-quarter hour of credit, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or
2) At least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph (1) of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institution including laboratory work, internships, practica, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours.

Students who wish to discuss the availability of services for people with physical disabilities or temporary disabilities, or who wish to report barrier problems, should contact the Director of Counseling and Career Services.
 



Academic Freedom Policy



Academic freedom includes, but is not necessarily limited to, the right to free inquiry, expression, and discussion. Faculty are members of a learned profession and stewards of this educational institution. When they speak or write as citizens, they should be free from institutional censorship or discipline. As educators, they should remember that the public may judge their profession and their institution by their utterances. SFBU will not retaliate against faculty members for sharing their convictions and responsible conclusions with their colleagues and students in their teaching and writing; however, faculty should not incorporate controversial matter that has no relation to their subject into their teaching. Faculty members are not authorized to engage in offensive speech such as hate speech or sexual harassment.
 



Credit Hour Policy



SFBU follows federal guidelines regarding credit hours.
Pursuant to 34 C.F.R. §600.2, a credit hour is an amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that is an institutionally established equivalency that reasonably approximates not less than –
1) One hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out-of-class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester or trimester hour of credit, or ten to twelve weeks for one-quarter hour of credit, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or
2) At least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph (1) of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institution including laboratory work, internships, practica, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours.
The above shall apply to both in-person and distance education modalities. 
One hour of classroom = One contact hour
One contact hour = 50 minutes of instruction
 



Transfer of Credit from Other Institutions



Undergraduate Transfer Credit
Course credit earned at other institutions of higher education may be transferable. Credit transfer is made by the admission evaluators while conducting the admission evaluation or by formal transfer agreement between institutions. The transfer of credit is done at the program-of-study level, topic area level, the major and major selectable levels and on a case-by-case basis. The following statements apply to all transfer credits:
The SFBU Admissions Office must receive all official transcripts prior to the student’s joining a degree program. Without preapproval, transcripts received after the student joins SFBU cannot be used in transferring credits, except for records from the term immediately preceding the student’s starting trimester at SFBU. Up to 75 units of courses that have been reviewed and currently approved as part of a formal SFBU articulation/transfer agreement are guaranteed to transfer.
The student was officially enrolled in the course.
Courses eligible for transfer by prearranged transfer / articulation agreement shall follow the details contained in the agreement. Courses eligible for one-to-one matching course transfer will be evaluated based on the comparability in content, quality and rigor with SFBU’s courses. Required courses require a closer comparability match. Courses eligible for topic area transfer may be mapped to the program's relevant topic area unit requirements without the need for one-to-one course matching and may have their units used to lieu of required units with the approval of the Registrar and School Dean. The transfer evaluation will include, but is not limited to, course descriptions, course syllabi, and/or general public information. Students may be asked to provide course catalogs or syllabi if needed. Up to 75 trimester units of courses that have been reviewed and currently approved as part of a formal SFBU articulation/transfer agreement are guaranteed to transfer.
When evaluating any foreign transcript, the admission evaluators may accept or transfer credit based on their knowledge of the course contents in comparison with similar courses offered in the U.S.
Without prior approval courses for transfer to SFBU may not be completed concurrently at another institution while a student is matriculated in an SFBU degree program.
College English courses taken at an institution where English is not an official language cannot be transferred for general education credit.
The credits under consideration for transfer must be earned at (1) institutions approved by the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education, (2) public or private institutions of higher learning accredited by an accrediting association recognized by the U. S. Department of Education, or (3) foreign institutions of higher learning. Credits earned at a foreign institution degree must be evaluated by a member of National Association of Credential Evaluation Services (NACES), Association of International Credential Evaluators (AICE), or American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO)’s International Education Services.
Professional Development Units (PDUs) offered by professional/industry organizations cannot be transferred to SFBU for academic credit.
Continuing Education Units (CEUs) offered on a non-academic basis by other academic institutions cannot be transferred to SFBU for academic credit.
The total credits transferred from other institutions to meet the student’s undergraduate program requirements are limited to 75 trimester units. Students must take at least 45 units at SFBU.
Credits transferred at the time of admission evaluation will reduce program length. Credit transferred from any outside institution has no effect on the calculation of the student’s GPA or CGPA.
Credits transferred from any outside institution are excluded from the maximum attempted units for the program.
Credits are transferred by the following conversion:
Definition of a Trimester Unit:
One trimester credit hour equals, at a minimum, 15 contact classroom hours of lecture, 30 contact hours of laboratory, or 45 contact hours of practicum.

Conversion Factor:
1 quarter unit = 0.66 trimester unit

Grades Required for Transfer Credit
In the bachelor's degree programs, applicable courses completed with an equivalency of a letter grade of "C" or better are transferable. ​Courses completed with Pass/No Pass are not transferable unless the transcript states that the general grading policy is not based on letter grades.

AP/IB course credit earned  which is considered to be equivalent to college credit.
Credit by Examination - CLEP

SFBU’s evaluation of an application is made prior to the student’s admission to a program unless otherwise approved by the authorizing VA office. The DANTES Institution Code for SFBU is 9670.

Graduate Transfer Credit
Graduate course credit earned at other accredited higher education institutions may be transferable to meet the student’s graduation requirements if the courses are closely related to the engineering course requirements in the student’s intended program of study and the grade earned meets the requirement stated below. Such course credits are considered qualified transfer credits. Credit transfer is made by the admission evaluators while conducting the admission evaluation.
The following statements apply to qualified transfer credits:
The SFBU Admissions Office must receive all official transcripts  prior to the student’s joining a degree program. Without preapproval, transcripts received after the student joins SFBU cannot be used in transferring credits, except for records from the term immediately preceding the student’s starting trimester at SFBU.

San Francisco Bay University (SFBU), in accordance with applicable Federal and State law and University policy, does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national, and/or ethnic origin, sex, marital status, gender identity, sexual orientation, pregnancy*, physical or mental disability, medical condition (cancer related or genetic characteristics), ancestry, religion, service in the uniformed services** , or age. SFBU also prohibits unlawful harassment including sexual harassment and sexual violence. This policy of non-discrimination applies to all aspects of admission, education, employment, financial aid, student activities, and other school-administered programs.

Student Grievance Policy and Procedure
 



SFBU takes grievances regarding the institution seriously. Students have the right to file a grievance that concerns SFBU, whether such grievances are with personnel, the course of study, general university policies, or other related matters. This policy describes the grievance procedure available to students.
1) INFORMAL RESOLUTION
SFBU highly encourages students to attempt to informally resolve concerns directly with the aggrieving party or department. Students are particularly encouraged to informally resolve academic matters, such as those involving course policies, with their instructor, or, if their instructor is not available, with their respective dean, prior to filing a grievance. Grade appeals may be made as described in the section of this catalog entitled “Grading Policy and Academic Standards.”
Even after initiating the formal grievance process, students are encouraged to seek informal resolution of their concerns. A student whose concerns are resolved may withdraw a formal grievance at any point in the process.
With regard to appeals of disciplinary action and all other grievances, including those related to harassment and discrimination, no student is obligated to attempt informal resolution and may bring a formal grievance to the administration as outlined in this policy.
2) TIMING
Academic grievances and appeals of disciplinary action must be received by the administration within 30 days of the close of the academic term in which the first incident giving rise to the grievance occurred or the notice date of the disciplinary action.
There is no deadline for other types of complaints.

 
3) GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE AND RESOLUTION
All grievances and supporting documentation shall be submitted in writing to the SFBU Compliance Department. The grievance should be made using the SFBU Grievance Form, which is available on the SFBU website.
Please note that if a grievance is being filed in order to appeal disciplinary action, the grievance must include a description of the basis of appeal. Failure to state the basis of the appeal in the initial grievance may result in denial of the appeal. The following are the only valid bases of appeal:
new evidence which could reasonably be expected to cause the individual(s) reviewing the grievance to overrule prior disciplinary action,
failure to follow published SFBU policies in a way that materially disadvantaged the student;
demonstrated bias or discrimination and (iv) the sanction imposed is substantially disproportionate to the severity of the violation.
The grievance may be sent via email to compliance@sfbu.edu or delivered in person to the front desk of the SFBU Administrative Building during normal business hours. If the grievance is regarding SFBU Compliance or its personnel, then the grievance may be sent to the Executive Vice President via in person delivery to the front desk of the SFBU Administrative Building during normal business hours. In such case, complainant should specify that the grievance is regarding compliance or its personnel. Intake personnel, generally a member of SFBU Compliance, will review the form. If the form is complete, intake personnel will, within 5 business days of receipt, acknowledge receipt of the grievance and forward it to the appropriate party for review and resolution. Matters are generally forwarded as follows:
Academic matters are forwarded to the Chief Academic Officer, or the Chief Academic Officer’s designee.
Appeals of disciplinary action are forwarded to the Executive Vice President, or the Executive Vice President’s designee.
All other complaints are assigned to a member of SFBU Compliance.
Depending upon the type and complexity of the grievance, the appropriate party may, in their discretion, adjudicate the matter or assign the matter to a Grievance committee.
Within 60 days of receipt of the grievance, SFBU shall provide a written response to the grievance via email. If further investigation is needed, the complainant will be provided with a written response to the grievance within 10 business days after completion of the investigation.
The complainant may appeal SFBU’s resolution by filing a statement of appeal that clearly describes the basis of appeal within 5 business days of the date of the written response. The President of SFBU, or the President’s designee, shall adjudicate the appeal within 30 days of SFBU’s receipt of complainant’s statement of appeal.
If a complainant has exhausted all grievance procedures provided under SFBU’s policies, the complainant may contact:
The WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC), 1080 Marina Village Parkway, Suite 500, Alameda, CA 94501, 510.748.9001.
4) NO RETALIATION
No member of the SFBU community shall be subject to adverse action by SFBU based upon the reasonable good faith filing or participation in a grievance.
5) MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS
Records for student complaints are maintained for at least 6 years. Records for grievances made by non-students are maintained in accordance with applicable university policy.
 



Reasonable Accommodation for Students with Disabilities
 



SFBU adheres to the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements and provides reasonable accommodations for students who are otherwise qualified but have disabilities. Such disabilities may include learning disabilities, health impairments and other documented conditions.

All grievances and supporting documentation shall be submitted in writing to the SFBU Compliance Department. The grievance should be made using the SFBU Grievance Form, which is available on the SFBU website.
Please note that if a grievance is being filed in order to appeal disciplinary action, the grievance must include a description of the basis of appeal. Failure to state the basis of the appeal in the initial grievance may result in denial of the appeal. The following are the only valid bases of appeal:
new evidence which could reasonably be expected to cause the individual(s) reviewing the grievance to overrule prior disciplinary action,
failure to follow published SFBU policies in a way that materially disadvantaged the student;
demonstrated bias or discrimination and (iv) the sanction imposed is substantially disproportionate to the severity of the violation.
The grievance may be sent via email to compliance@sfbu.edu or delivered in person to the front desk of the SFBU Administrative Building during normal business hours. If the grievance is regarding SFBU Compliance or its personnel, then the grievance may be sent to the Executive Vice President via in person delivery to the front desk of the SFBU Administrative Building during normal business hours. In such case, complainant should specify that the grievance is regarding compliance or its personnel. Intake personnel, generally a member of SFBU Compliance, will review the form. If the form is complete, intake personnel will, within 5 business days of receipt, acknowledge receipt of the grievance and forward it to the appropriate party for review and resolution. Matters are generally forwarded as follows:
Academic matters are forwarded to the Chief Academic Officer, or the Chief Academic Officer’s designee.
Appeals of disciplinary action are forwarded to the Executive Vice President, or the Executive Vice President’s designee.
All other complaints are assigned to a member of SFBU Compliance.
Depending upon the type and complexity of the grievance, the appropriate party may, in their discretion, adjudicate the matter or assign the matter to a Grievance committee.
Within 60 days of receipt of the grievance, SFBU shall provide a written response to the grievance via email. If further investigation is needed, the complainant will be provided with a written response to the grievance within 10 business days after completion of the investigation.
The complainant may appeal SFBU’s resolution by filing a statement of appeal that clearly describes the basis of appeal within 5 business days of the date of the written response. The President of SFBU, or the President’s designee, shall adjudicate the appeal within 30 days of SFBU’s receipt of complainant’s statement of appeal.
If a complainant has exhausted all grievance procedures provided under SFBU’s policies, the complainant may contact:
The WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC), 1080 Marina Village Parkway, Suite 500, Alameda, CA 94501, 510.748.9001.
4) NO RETALIATION
No member of the SFBU community shall be subject to adverse action by SFBU based upon the reasonable good faith filing or participation in a grievance.
5) MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS
Records for student complaints are maintained for at least 6 years. Records for grievances made by non-students are maintained in accordance with applicable university policy.
 



Reasonable Accommodation for Students with Disabilities
 



SFBU adheres to the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements and provides reasonable accommodations for students who are otherwise qualified but have disabilities. Such disabilities may include learning disabilities, health impairments and other documented conditions.
Students who wish to discuss the availability of services for people with physical disabilities or temporary disabilities, or who wish to report barrier problems, should contact the Director of Counseling and Career Services.
 



Academic Freedom Policy



Academic freedom includes, but is not necessarily limited to, the right to free inquiry, expression, and discussion. Faculty are members of a learned profession and stewards of this educational institution. When they speak or write as citizens, they should be free from institutional censorship or discipline. As educators, they should remember that the public may judge their profession and their institution by their utterances. SFBU will not retaliate against faculty members for sharing their convictions and responsible conclusions with their colleagues and students in their teaching and writing; however, faculty should not incorporate controversial matter that has no relation to their subject into their teaching. Faculty members are not authorized to engage in offensive speech such as hate speech or sexual harassment.
 



Credit Hour Policy



SFBU follows federal guidelines regarding credit hours.
Pursuant to 34 C.F.R. §600.2, a credit hour is an amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that is an institutionally established equivalency that reasonably approximates not less than –
1) One hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out-of-class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester or trimester hour of credit, or ten to twelve weeks for one-quarter hour of credit, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or
2) At least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph (1) of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institution including laboratory work, internships, practica, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours.
The above shall apply to both in-person and distance education modalities. 
One hour of classroom = One contact hour
One contact hour = 50 minutes of instruction
 



Transfer of Credit from Other Institutions



Undergraduate Transfer Credit
Course credit earned at other institutions of higher education may be transferable. Credit transfer is made by the admission evaluators while conducting the admission evaluation or by formal transfer agreement between institutions. The transfer of credit is done at the program-of-study level, topic area level, the major and major selectable levels and on a case-by-case basis. The following statements apply to all transfer credits:
The SFBU Admissions Office must receive all official transcripts prior to the student’s joining a degree program. Without preapproval, transcripts received after the student joins SFBU cannot be used in transferring credits, except for records from the term immediately preceding the student’s starting trimester at SFBU. Up to 75 units of courses that have been reviewed and currently approved as part of a formal SFBU articulation/transfer agreement are guaranteed to transfer.
The student was officially enrolled in the course.
Courses eligible for transfer by prearranged transfer / articulation agreement shall follow the details contained in the agreement. Courses eligible for one-to-one matching course transfer will be evaluated based on the comparability in content, quality and rigor with SFBU’s courses. Required courses require a closer comparability match. Courses eligible for topic area transfer may be mapped to the program's relevant topic area unit requirements without the need for one-to-one course matching and may have their units used to lieu of required units with the approval of the Registrar and School Dean. The transfer evaluation will include, but is not limited to, course descriptions, course syllabi, and/or general public information. Students may be asked to provide course catalogs or syllabi if needed. Up to 75 trimester units of courses that have been reviewed and currently approved as part of a formal SFBU articulation/transfer agreement are guaranteed to transfer.
When evaluating any foreign transcript, the admission evaluators may accept or transfer credit based on their knowledge of the course contents in comparison with similar courses offered in the U.S.
Without prior approval courses for transfer to SFBU may not be completed concurrently at another institution while a student is matriculated in an SFBU degree program.
College English courses taken at an institution where English is not an official language cannot be transferred for general education credit.
The credits under consideration for transfer must be earned at (1) institutions approved by the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education, (2) public or private institutions of higher learning accredited by an accrediting association recognized by the U. S. Department of Education, or (3) foreign institutions of higher learning. Credits earned at a foreign institution degree must be evaluated by a member of National Association of Credential Evaluation Services (NACES), Association of International Credential Evaluators (AICE), or American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO)’s International Education Services.
Professional Development Units (PDUs) offered by professional/industry organizations cannot be transferred to SFBU for academic credit.
Continuing Education Units (CEUs) offered on a non-academic basis by other academic institutions cannot be transferred to SFBU for academic credit.
The total credits transferred from other institutions to meet the student’s undergraduate program requirements are limited to 75 trimester units. Students must take at least 45 units at SFBU.
Credits transferred at the time of admission evaluation will reduce program length. Credit transferred from any outside institution has no effect on the calculation of the student’s GPA or CGPA.
Credits transferred from any outside institution are excluded from the maximum attempted units for the program.
Credits are transferred by the following conversion:
Definition of a Trimester Unit:
One trimester credit hour equals, at a minimum, 15 contact classroom hours of lecture, 30 contact hours of laboratory, or 45 contact hours of practicum.

Conversion Factor:
1 quarter unit = 0.66 trimester unit

Grades Required for Transfer Credit
In the bachelor's degree programs, applicable courses completed with an equivalency of a letter grade of "C" or better are transferable. ​Courses completed with Pass/No Pass are not transferable unless the transcript states that the general grading policy is not based on letter grades. This policy must be in writing from the institution (transcript key or a letter of verification).
Other Types of Undergraduate Transfer Credit
The following other types of credit may be transferable:
AP/IB course credit earned  which is considered to be equivalent to college credit.
Credit by Examination - CLEP
SFBU grants credit to those students who pass examinations in English, natural sciences, humanities, and social science subjects offered by the College Level Examination Program (CLEP). Only General Education credits will be granted. Students should consult with the Admissions Office for information on acceptable CLEP scores and units. The CLEP Institution Code for SFBU is 7569.

Transfer of Credit from Defense Activity for Nontraditional Education Support (DANTES) and Military Services
Credits will be allowed for DANTES Subject Standardized Tests and professional military education evaluated by the American Council on Education (ACE). The maximum transferable credits follow the same policies as specified above. SFBU’s evaluation of an application is made prior to the student’s admission to a program unless otherwise approved by the authorizing VA office. The DANTES Institution Code for SFBU is 9670.

Graduate Transfer Credit
Graduate course credit earned at other accredited higher education institutions may be transferable to meet the student’s graduation requirements if the courses are closely related to the engineering course requirements in the student’s intended program of study and the grade earned meets the requirement stated below. Such course credits are considered qualified transfer credits. Credit transfer is made by the admission evaluators while conducting the admission evaluation.
The following statements apply to qualified transfer credits:
The SFBU Admissions Office must receive all official transcripts  prior to the student’s joining a degree program. Without preapproval, transcripts received after the student joins SFBU cannot be used in transferring credits, except for records from the term immediately preceding the student’s starting trimester at SFBU. Up to 12 units of courses that have been reviewed and currently approved as part of a formal SFBU articulation/transfer agreement are guaranteed to transfer.
The student was officially enrolled in the course.
Courses eligible for transfer will be evaluated based on the comparability in content, quality and rigor of SFBU’s courses. The transfer evaluation will include, but is not limited to, course descriptions, course syllabi, and/or general public information. Students may be asked to provide course catalogs or syllabi if needed. Up to 12 units of courses that have been reviewed and currently approved as part of a formal SFBU articulation/transfer agreement are guaranteed to transfer.
No more than 12 units of qualified graduate-level course credits may be transferred. Students must take at least 24 units at SFBU degree program.
Without prior approval, courses for transfer to SFBU may not be completed concurrently at another institution while a student is matriculated in an SFBU.
The credits contemplated for transfer must be earned at (1) institutions approved by the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education, (2) public or private institutions of higher learning accredited by an accrediting association recognized by the U. S. Department of Education, or (3) foreign institutions of higher learning. Credits earned at a foreign institution degree must be evaluated by a member of National Association of Credential Evaluation Services (NACES), Association of International Credential Evaluators (AICE), or American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO)’s International Education Services.
Professional Development Units (PDUs) offered by professional/industry organizations cannot be transferred to SFBU for academic credit.
Continuing Education Units (CEUs) offered on a non-academic basis by other academic institutions cannot be transferred to SFBU for academic credit.
Credits transferred, performed at the time of admission evaluation will reduce program length. Credit transferred from any outside institution has no effect on the calculation of the student’s GPA or CGPA.
Credits transferred from any outside institution are excluded from the maximum attempted units for the program.
Credits are transferred by the following conversion:
Definition of a Trimester Unit:
One trimester credit hour equals, at a minimum, 15 contact classroom hours of lecture, 30 contact hours of laboratory, or 45 contact hours of practicum.

Conversion Factor:
1 quarter unit = 0.66 trimester unit

Grades Required for Transfer Credit
In the master’s degree programs, qualified courses completed with an equivalency of a letter grade of "B" or better are transferable. Courses completed with Pass/No Pass are not transferable unless the transcript states that the general grading policy is not based on letter grades. This policy must be in writing from the institution (transcript key or a letter of verification).

Alumni Spotlight: Michael Tang




 


 
Michael Tang
Master's in Electrical Engineering
 
When Michael Tang first went to San Francisco Bay University, he had no idea he'd end up working there, starting his own company and eventually joining another startup that went public for big bucks.
 
After graduating with a master’s degree in electrical engineering, Tang worked at SFBU as the deputy director for admissions and director of placement. He would market the university to students and help them with internship and job opportunities.
 
He was attracted to the university because past President George Hsieh was his mentor. Tang was accepted to various institutions, but it was Hsieh’s seminar on Emotional Quotient and Intelligence Quotient that motivated him to attend SFBU in the heart of Silicon Valley.
 
“The education here I think inspires people to push their curiosity to the next level, especially in technology,” Tang said. “Because we are at such a crossroads of humanity and technology and design here, I got exposed to all the company cultures in the area and was inspired to study."
 
“And I think, as a student, the drive to know more will eventually push you to explore deeper in the subject that you are interested in, which is the most important thing. It's not the knowledge itself. It's that motivation behind that, to push us students to explore more.”
 
His advice to students is to make as many connections as possible. While working at SFBU after graduation, he was hosting a short-term rental and had the opportunity to meet all sorts of people. By chance, a businessman named David Kanel stayed over, and the relationship changed his life. The two of them started working together with other founding team members and raised money for the startup Boxc Logistics, launching Tang’s career to further heights.
 
From there, Tang joined mobile e-commerce marketplace Wish and helped build up its logistic infrastructure and system. It went public in 2020, and the father of two daughters is still excitedly constructing logistic solutions for the next generation of e-commerce.
 
"If you have connections, you can connect technology, you can connect people, then you're halfway through success,” Tang said. “It's all about connecting dots and believing in yourself and taking a leap of faith. Sometimes you don't know what's going to be happening ahead of you. You just need to trust that it’s going to be great.”

Resources




The helpful staff and resources at SFBU’s Career Center can assist in your career development while you are a student and after you graduate. Career Center staff members are experienced with high tech industries, non-profit organizations, and more.
Our staff can help you with the following:
Career planning and readiness
Career-related articles
CPT - Curricular Practical Training (internships)
Networking
Job skills workshops
Resume writing
Interviewing skills
Job fairs
Job searches
Current jobs information

Resumes
Resumes show potential employers how your abilities and experiences are suited for the position you are pursuing. The purpose of a resume is to secure an interview, and, once at the interview, you must be able to showcase your skills verbally. Begin the process of crafting your resume by making an appointment with SFBU’s Career Center for help.
The following links show what a resume looks like:
https://careers.umbc.edu/students/documents/resumes/ 
https://careers.umbc.edu/students/documents/resumes/dos-and-donts/
Strong action verbs such as “oversaw” are more effective in a resume than weak verbs like “was” and “did.” Follow this link for a list of strong action verbs:
https://careers.umbc.edu/students/documents/resumes/action-verbs/ 

Cover Letters
Cover letters are your opportunity to introduce yourself to an employer and allow you to express what makes you the best fit for a particular position. For this reason, sending a cover letter is a good idea even when the employer states that it is not needed. Further advice and exemplar cover letters can be found by following these links:

Searching for a Job

SFBU’s Career Services meets students one-on-one to help them define their goals, make decisions, and begin planning their careers. Afterward, staff offer resources, various job skill trainings, advice about networking, access to jobs and internships, and guidance throughout the process of searching for a job.

Networking
The following are useful pointers to help you create and maintain a network, which is important in finding the ideal job.
Establishing your network: Assess the network that you already have first. You may have more connections than you realize.
Focus on quality as opposed to quantity
Practice a 30-second pitch
Listen actively
Take notes
Follow up
Return favors
Maintaining your network:After developing your network, maintaining it is critical, even after you find work. You may not require help from your network right away, but it could be useful when you don’t expect it. The following tips will help your professional connections stay strong:
 Here are some easy steps to keep your professional relationships strong:   
Use social networks actively:  share industry-related articles on LinkedIn weekly, if possible. Send information that you think would interest a particular connection straight to that person, along with a short message. Also, post career updates regularly so that your connections are aware of developments in your career.
Maintain a close small network:determine who your most valuable contacts are, and interact with them via email or phone call a few times each year to ask what is going on with them in their careers and in general. These personal communications are more significant than posts on social media, which is best suited for maintaining contact with more distant connections. If nothing else, you have something important in common with them; you’ve both received a top-notch education from a San Francisco Bay area university. Networking is easier when you focus on points of common interest.
Help your contacts: whenever you believe that one of your connections may be able to help another, suggest that they connect with each other. This effort will demonstrate to both of your connections that their success is important to you, and they may be more likely to think about you when opportunities arise in the future.

Interviewing
How to Answer the 'Why Do You Want to Work for Us?' Interview Question 
Source:  https://www.vault.com/blogs/interviewing/how-to-answer-the-why-do-you-want-to-work-for-us-interview-question 
One of the more common interview questions these days, especially for entry-level positions, is some form of "Why do you want to work for us?" Other forms of this question include "What attracts you to our firm?" and "What about our firm excites you?" Whatever the exact phrasing you receive, there are a few things you want to get across as clearly and concisely as possible when answering. San Francisco Bay University should help you answer these questions in the following ways:



1. You know a lot about the firm; you've done your research.



One of the things this question aims to do is gauge how well you prepare yourself for meetings and work situations. Will you do the prep work? Will you take the time to be extremely knowledgeable before showing up? Note that it's not too difficult and doesn't take too much to do some basic research about a company. All the information you need is a Google search away. So make sure to look at the company's website, look at their products and/or services, read about their leaders and team, make sure you understand their place in the market and their strategy. Also read their press releases and about any awards and honors they've received. And then do some reading outside their site. Check out their Wiki page, read some news articles about them. And while you do your research, take notes of the things that genuinely excite and impress you. Then, when you're done researching (maybe an hour at most is fine), take a look at your notes and choose three things to mention in your interview. Ideally, you'll practice, either aloud or just in your mind, how you might get these three things across clearly and concisely in your interview.



2. You're very enthusiastic about the prospect of working there.



While you answer this question, keep in mind that interviewers are gauging your excitement level of working for them. They want candidates who are extremely enthusiastic, since that enthusiasm for the company and their work will more often than not turn into good work being done if you're hired. If you're not enthusiastic, or don't show that you are, then interviewers will view you as someone who might be a deadbeat, downer type of employee, meaning a low performer. Companies want upbeat, enthusiastic people on their teams. They want people excited about their strategy, mission, products, and services. So when answering this question, make sure your interviewers understand that all of the things you know about their company truly excite you, and that you'd be thrilled to join them and their mission and help them reach their goals.



3. Your skills, experience, and goals are a good fit for the role and company.



Speaking of goals, interviewers know that, like companies, individuals also have them. And interviewers are looking for candidates whose goals match up with the company's. They want someone whose career goals will be a good fit for the specific role and for the company as a whole. So, when you're researching the role (you will, of course, know the job description backwards and forwards before you interview) and the company, you want to take note of the things that mesh with your goals. For example, if you want to get involved in a certain sector, and the company is involved in that, then you want to point that out to your interviewer. Or, say, if one of your goals/desires is to manage more and more people and so working for a high growth company whose team is growing is important to you, then get that across. Other things that might mesh with your career goals include working for a certain size of firm (big, small, startup, etc.), working for a firm with a certain geographic reach (international, a specific U.S. region, etc.), working in a certain type of culture (open, transparent, collaborative, etc.). Whatever the case might be, get as specific as possible, and spell out that what you're looking to do and learn at this point in your career is a good fit for the specific role and firm. Of course, be honest. Don't force yourself into a role or company that won't be a good fit for you. Never forget that interviewing is a two-way street: you're interviewing the company as much as they're interviewing you.

Personal Counseling




SFBU's Counseling Office helps students manage a host of issues. These might include interpersonal relationships, cultural problems, lack of confidence or self-esteem, and myriad other concerns. All counseling sessions are confidential and function as safe spaces without judgment. Students who require care beyond the SFBU counseling program's scope are referred to counseling at SFBU’s partner, ACI (https://myassistanceprogram.com/aci/students/).
The Counseling Office also provides students with academic performance tips, strategies for coping with test anxiety or university life in general, and related help with their educational journey. As a premier bay area university, SFBU wants students to feel comfortable asking questions and getting advice from the counseling office. If students feel anxious about falling behind or not meeting goals,SFBU recommends counseling sessions to help them set reasonable goals and get back on track. The counselors are here to help with any issue that might restrict students' ability to succeed at SFBU.

SFBU Housing Rules, Regulations, and Policies



In accordance with its mission statement, the SFBU Housing Department has established the following rules and regulations in order to make dormitory life pleasant and safe for all students. These regulations have been established to ensure the safety and quiet enjoyment of the property by all residents. Students residing in university housing are required to sign a lease and a room condition form upon moving in and moving out. All SFBU students must observe and obey the guidelines listed below. Failure to abide by these policies may result in forfeiting rent payments and deposits, fines, or other disciplinary action, up to and including the loss of housing privileges.
Students Entering Spring 2022
Effective 9/24/21, the housing scholarship for any newly-admitted students is available only for a period of two consecutive trimesters.
Unfortunately, housing is limited; thus, the housing scholarship is contingent on housing availability. A spot is not guaranteed until it is confirmed by the Housing Department.
University Property
Students are responsible for keeping their rooms and the common areas clean and neat at all times. All students sharing a dormitory should share the responsibility for the common areas; they are to avoid causing any damage to their rooms, furnishings, fixtures, and appliances. Students are obligated to treat university property with respect. A student who violates the dormitory rules stated below or who intentionally or carelessly damages the dormitory will be fined and expelled from student housing immediately.
SFBU Housing personnel check the dorms regularly to ensure that they are in good condition. The university has the authority to take necessary steps to protect residents and properties.
Specific dormitory regulations include the following:
No overnight guests are allowed in the dormitory.
Furniture:
	No furniture will be removed from the dormitory.
If a student needs to bring in his or her own furniture, approval must be obtained in advance from the Housing Department.
No furniture can be disassembled.
No alterations can be made.

Property accessories and fixtures:
	Absolutely no alterations can be made, and nothing can be removed.

Wall Decorations
	Nothing can be glued or nailed to the wall.

Students are not allowed to tamper with electrical and plumbing fixtures, nor any accessories in the unit. Penalties will be imposed if violations occur.
Students are not allowed access to rooftops for any purpose.
Any necessary repairs should be reported to SFBU Housing staff, and should not be attempted by students.
Students may not display neon lights, commercial signs, or offensive material from their dormitory room windows.
SFBU will provide only a bed frame, mattress, desk, chair, and floor lamp if requested. Students must bring their own bedding, such as blankets, pillows, and bedsheets, plus cookware and utensils.
Vandalism
Along with other types of vandalism, intentional breaking of glass (bottles, windows, etc.) is prohibited, and will result in fines and/or loss of dormitory privileges.
Installation for Personal Convenience
Installations added for personal convenience, such as telephone, cable TV, and other electronic devices are the responsibility of the student, and must first be approved by the Housing department. Cost of such installation is the responsibility of the student.
Internet Networking Usage
The primary purpose of each dormitory computer networking internet device is to support student academic activity. No guarantee is made regarding speed or ability to use services such as internet music, television programs, movies, streaming, online chatting, Skype, webcams, gaming platforms such as X-Box and Playstation, and so on.
Residents are not permitted to tamper with dormitory networking equipment or devices, including firewalls, routers, and wireless access points.
Students who prefer to install their own internet connection must get approval from the SFBU Housing department. Students failing to obtain proper approval will be responsible for costs associated with restoring the original internet connection.
Excessive or improper use of bandwidth or internet networking software that disrupts, inhibits, or interferes with other users is not permitted.
Rents and Deposits
Rents and deposits are prepaid, as required by each student’s lease. Applications and all payments are due by the dates specified above. If payments are not received, the housing application will be cancelled automatically. No exceptions will be made.
Renewing Dormitory Housing
Only qualified residents may renew residency in SFBU dormitories. Applications for renewing housing residency for each trimester must be received three weeks before the trimester starts. All students, including students with housing scholarships, must submit the renewal housing application form each trimester. The deadline to pay renewal rent is five working days before the trimester starts.
Withdraw and Refund
The security deposit is fully refundable for cancellations prior to the Housing Opening Date, as listed for each trimester in SFBU’s Housing calendar. If the student moves into university housing, the security deposit is refundable, but may be subject to certain deductions as authorized by law (e.g., cleaning, damage repair, and restoration or replacement of furniture, furnishings, or other items).
Cancellation prior to Move-In Date: full refund
Cancellation on or after Move-In Date: no refund
Students must be admitted to SFBU and either enrolled in a program full time prior to the Move-In Date, or be international students on approved trimester breaks. No one else is permitted to occupy a space in university housing, and must vacate university housing immediately. SFBU will not refund the housing fee.
Moving In
Check-in time will be from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, on university working days only. If students arrive outside of this timeframe, they must make their own arrangements to stay somewhere else and check in during the days and hours indicated above. Students cannot move in sooner than five days prior to the start of a trimester.
Moving Out
Moving out must be completed by 5:00 p.m. the day after the last day of the trimester, unless a renewal application is approved.
Moving out early: -

	Student without housing scholarship:no refund of rent shall be granted if a student moves out prior to the end of a lease term.
Student with housing scholarship: you are obligated to inform SFBU Housing if you want to move out early. If, at any time, SFBU discovers that you are not occupying your unit for two consecutive weeks, you will lose your housing privileges. SFBU will assign your unit to the next student on the waiting list.

Maintaining Clean and Orderly Premises:  SFBU Housing personnel and the student will do a walk-through on the student’s move-out date. Students must return units in the same condition that they were in when they checked in. If students fail to abide by these terms, a fine or reduction of the security deposit may be assessed.
Returning Keys:  students must return all keys by the date that Housing personnel gives the student to move out. Returning keys late will result in a $10/day fine to the student.
Rights Held by the University
The university reserves the following rights:
For authorized personnel to enter for inspection, repair, emergency, or any other appropriate reasons, such as after receiving a report of suspected violations of university conduct or regulations. No early notification is needed.
To levy and collect charges for damage to or unauthorized use of the dorm, or alterations to rooms or other items in the dorm.
To remove unauthorized or improperly used equipment.
To reassign, evict, or levy fines against students who violate these rules, regulations, and policies.
Fire Codes
Students are expected to observe the following fire code regulations. Violators of these regulations are subject to disciplinary action, including fines, payment for any damages, and cancellation of housing privileges.
For the protection of residents, dormitories are equipped with smoke and fire detection and prevention devices. Tampering with the smoke detector and alarm system or with fire extinguishers is a violation of rules as well as a violation of the city fire code.
Hallways must be kept clear at all times. Furniture and personal belongings such as bicycles, trunks, boxes, and clothing drying racks may not be placed in the hallways.
No ceiling hangings of any type are permissible, as they interfere with the proper functioning of the fire and smoke detection and prevention devices.
No lighting or heating device which produces an open flame is allowed in the dormitory. This includes candles and kerosene lamps. Hot plates, toaster ovens, coffee pots and tea kettles, auxiliary heaters, clothing irons, and curling or straightening irons for hair should not be placed on the carpet or other flammable surfaces.
Boxes made of cardboard and similar materials may not be stored in places where gas water heaters are present.
Bicycles are not allowed in dormitory common areas, halls, stairwells, or anywhere they obstruct exits. They must be stored only in designated bike storage areas.
Personal refrigerators are not allowed in student rooms.
Cohabitation
Students of the opposite sex are not assigned to and may not arrange to live together in the same dorm. Students are not allowed to bring in anyone to live in their assigned unit. Violation may result in cancellation of housing privileges.
Common Areas
Common areas are provided to dormitory residents as spaces in which they may congregate outside their personal rooms. They are places of gathering, used for dorm meetings, movie and television viewing, dining, preparing meals, group studying, and relaxing. Residents must be respectful of the rights of other students who share these spaces, and must be mindful of the noise generated. The Quiet Hour policy applies from 8:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m.
Common spaces must NOT be used for any activity which restricts any resident’s use of the common areas, or for an activity that results in the violation of university policies.
Access must be limited to residents and their guests; a resident must always accompany guests. No guest is allowed in the dormitory for an extended period or overnight. Guests are allowed only as long as the visit does not disturb the other resident(s) in the unit.
Quiet Hours
In order to secure the right of students to read and to study free from unreasonable noise and other distractions, the university asks students in all dorms to respect "quiet hours," which are designated evening hours during which residents are expected to observe quiet behavior. Daily quiet hours are from 8:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. During Midterm Examination and Final Examination weeks, students are requested to respect other students at all times.
No Pets
Students living in dormitories may not keep pets anywhere on the property. Substantial fines may be imposed for violations of this policy.
No Smoking
Smoking is not allowed in the dormitories or within 20 feet of the property, including the garage, the front and back yards, and any deck or patio. If Housing staff members find any evidence of smoking, such as cigarette butts within the dorm, the student will be asked to move out immediately, and a fine may be assessed.
No Alcohol Use
Alcoholic beverages are not allowed in dormitories. Opened containers of alcoholic beverages, including cups, are forbidden within the dorm and anywhere on the premises. If Housing staff members find any alcoholic bottles, containers, or cans within the above areas, the student will be asked to move out immediately, and a fine will be imposed.
No Parties
The university and Housing department does not permit parties in the dormitories. If Housing staff members receive a complaint from neighbors or the property manager, the student will be asked to move out immediately, and a fine will be assessed.
No Subletting
Dormitory spaces are allocated by SFBU Housing staff, and SFBU owns all dorm spaces. Students are not allowed to sublease the room to any other persons. If Housing staff members discover a sublease, the student’s housing privileges will be forfeited, and the student will be asked to move out immediately.
In the event that an individual living in SFBU housing becomes aware of a room being subleased, it is expected that such individual shall report the existence of the sublease immediately to a member of SFBU Housing staff.
Key Service
There is a $15 key service fee each time a student needs assistance to open a door. This service fee is raised to $25 for requests made outside of normal business hours and on weekends.
Any lost key must be reported immediately so that the locks can be changed, and residents of the unit can be issued new keys. The charge for changing locks (including the main entrance door and room door) and for copies of the new keys will depend on the actual receipt provided by a locksmith after the work is done.
Personal Possessions
University insurance does not cover loss of personal items. Students should take precautions to protect personal belongings from theft, fire, water damage, or other loss. Students are required to purchase their own rental insurance.
Break Time
SFBU reserves the right to make changes to dorm settings or to reassign dorm spaces during break time between trimesters, which starts on dorm closing day and ends on dorm opening day. Please make sure to check the Housing policy as well as move-in and move-out dates on the SFBU Housing webpages.

SFBU-AC Transit EasyPass Program




 

All full-time San Francisco Bay University (SFBU) students are eligible for the AC Transit SFBU EasyPass - the annual bus pass that allows students to go anywhere AC Transit goes - anytime!
EasyPass is great for your campus community, the environment, and your checkbook. The popular student benefit provides for an awesome discount. Compared to driving or purchasing your own transit passes, having an EasyPass can save you thousands of dollars a year, freeing up money for books, tuition, or anything else. Whether you use your EasyPass as back up transportation or use it every day, students can save big with EasyPass.
Passes are distributed to eligible students who have registered and signed the Pass Acceptance Form. The program uses the Clipper fare card with Photo ID. Your first EasyPass card will be available for pick-up at the San Francisco Bay University Administration Office usually at the start of the first trimester you qualify.
Full-time eligible students who attend all three trimesters (Summer, Fall and Spring) will have an active SFBU EasyPass all year long. SFBU's EasyPass will be automatically loaded onto your original EasyPass card every trimester that you qualify, so keep your card long-term.
 
For questions about eligibility, contact the SFBU EasyPass Site Coordinator
at Room 127 at 161 Mission Falls Ln, Fremont, CA, 94539. Hours: Monday-Friday, 9:00 A.M. - 5:30 P.M. You can also email easypass@sfbu.edu.
 
SFBU EasyPass Rules:
The Pass is valid on all AC Transit buses (local and transbay). The SFBU EasyPass is not valid on the Dumbarton Express (use Line U instead).
All Pass holders must tag their EasyPass on the Clipper card reader upon entering an AC Transit bus.
The Pass is valid only for the dates shown in your EasyPass welcome letter.
The Pass is not transferable or refundable, and will be revoked if used by anyone else; your card must be presented to AC Transit personnel for inspection upon request. AC Transit personnel have the right to confiscate your Clipper card if they feel the EasyPass is being used fraudulently.
Any attempt to transfer or sell the Pass may result in criminal charges; a fine of up to $250 (or community service) can be imposed for the misuse of your Pass with the intent to evade the payment of fares (California Penal Code 640). San Francisco Bay University may impose additional penalties.
 
Still Have Questions?  For Check out the following publications:
For help with your card, call Clipper toll-free at (877) 878-8883;  with your card number in hand and always identify yourself as an SFBU EasyPass participant.

Transportation




Transportation in the San Francisco Bay Area as well as in the U.S. in general can be surprising for people who come from countries with convenient, dependable, and modern public transportation systems. In contrast to residents of Asian and European cities, the majority of people in the U.S. tend to use private instead of public transportation, particularly automobiles. As a result, using a bus, train, taxi, or bicycle may be more challenging, and you may find fewer choices. Prices may be higher, services may not run all night, and the time between buses and trains may be longer. Except in big cities, taxis must be arranged by calling a taxi company, and the costs are considerably higher than for service within a big city. 
This page contains links which can help you learn about various options for transportation during your time at SFBU. Students attending colleges and universities in the Bay Area have access to a wide array of transportation options.
Airport to Fremont
Various modes of transportation can get you to San Francisco Bay University from any of the three area airports. Some transportation services are listed below, but many other options are available. Please coordinate your transportation by contacting the following companies or other services.

Lyft, available via app
Uber, available via app
Merit Taxi (650) 571-0606 
Charity Cab (925) 353-5357 
Fremont Jet Cab (510) 300-5777 
Yellow Smart Cab (650) 966-6000 
San Jose Airport Taxi (408) 600-6352 
San Francisco Airport has zones for taxis at the center islands of its roadways. However, some taxis do not go to Fremont. For this reason, arranging transportation ahead of time is the best way to make sure that you arrive in Fremont as planned. 
SFBU is not affiliated with any company listed above; therefore, it cannot be held liable or responsible for any acts or behaviors of either the drivers or the businesses.

CPT, OPT and On-Campus Employment




Curricular Practical Training (CPT)
CPT involves cooperative education, internships, work/study arrangements, or other types of practicum provided through employers, in agreement with San Francisco Bay University. Students should review the CPT Process Guide for the latest information about these exciting opportunities.

CPT Process Guide
Optional Practical Training (OPT) for International Students
With OPT, international students with F-1 status for two consecutive trimesters who plan on working in the United States within their current field of study can receive work authorizations. Designated advisors at SFBU recommend students for OPT. However, the final approvals go through the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS). Students interested in the OPT process should log into their SFBU student portal to review the related OPT requirements.
Student Portal Login
Job Opportunities with SFBU
Students can apply for a limited number of SFBU jobs every trimester. These opportunities are within the administrative, instructional, and facilities management departments at SFBU. They are part-time roles available as needed, and are open to qualified students. Students should go to the eCareer Center Job Board on their SFBU student portal account to find available positions.

Curricular Practical Training (CPT)





Good to Know About CPT at SFBU:
CPT is both a course and a job which helps prepare you as a professional. There are no restrictions on what you may earn on the job; however, the focus of the training is to allow the student real-world professional practice as part of a course. The curricular practicum must provide students with a valuable learning experience and must significantly increase their knowledge in their program of study.
 
Applying for CPT
F-1 students are eligible for CPT after completing 2 full-time trimesters at SFBU. The deadline to apply for CPT is Week 11 of the working period. e.g. if you are interested in taking CPT during the Summer 2023 trimester, the deadline to submit the application is Week 11 of Summer 2023.
You can submit the application on your student portal under My Requests -> Academic Requests -> CPT Application.
 
Start and End Dates
You may begin your CPT during the trimester break prior to the start of the trimester or at any time during the trimester’s first twelve (12) weeks. Your end date must be the last day of the trimester.
 
Continuing CPT
If you plan to continue with the same job, you will need to register for a new CPT course in the next trimester by completing a new request and following the process again. Apply early so there is no interruption.
 
Trimester Break
Students who are on a complete trimester break will have to pay a registration fee, learning resource fee, campus fee, and an insurance fee as well as the CPT course tuition fee.
 
Social Security Card
If you do not have a social security number (SSN), the CPT advisor will provide you with a letter in support of your SSN. This letter is issued by a Designated School Official (DSO) upon approval of your CPT. You will need to apply for an SSN at a local Social Security Administration office.
 
Optional Practical Training (OPT)
Please be aware that if you wish to take OPT after you graduate, you must not take more than 12 months of full-time CPT at your current academic level (undergraduate or graduate). There are no restrictions on OPT eligibility for part-time CPT.



Frequently Asked Questions




Do I qualify for CPT if I transferred from another institution in the United States?



Students who have studied at another institution for a period of time preceding him/her joining SFBU can have that period be counted towards their CPT eligibility. Simply ensure that you meet all the requirements. (Refer to Step 1)





What if I am currently working on changing my Visa status, such as H4 to F1?



You can apply for CPT upon receiving your F1 status. Simply ensure you meet all the requirements. (Refer to Step 1)





I am a U. S. Citizen (or legal permanent resident), can I take CPT?



Yes, you are eligible for CPT and are able to take CPT immediately.





What if my employers’ corporate office is outside of California?



Students must adhere to the 50 mile radius rule. However, if your employer has a local clientele office, you can work so long as their local address is specified in your job offer letter and in your CPT application.





How many times can I enroll in CPT?



No more than 6 units of practicum coursework may be counted towards graduation.





Will my reports be graded?



Reports will be graded on a Satisfactory (S)/No Pass (NP) basis. Reports that are incomplete or submitted late have the consequence of receiving a NP grade. If a student receives two NP grades, their CPT will be terminated and they will receive a failing grade in the course. Students who fail CPT will not receive future opportunities to participate in CPT again.





I am authorized for CPT, but what do I do if I change my mind, change my visa status or something about my job changes?



For any changes in your CPT, you must notify the CPT Advisor immediately. If you're an international student, the CPT Advisor may have to amend or cancel your CPT I-20.

Curricular Practical Training (CPT)
Good to Know About CPT at SFBU:
CPT is both a course and a job which helps prepare you as a professional. There are no restrictions on what you may earn on the job; however, the focus of the training is to allow the student real-world professional practice as part of a course. The curricular practicum must provide students with a valuable learning experience and must significantly increase their knowledge in their program of study.

 

Applying for CPT
F-1 students are eligible for CPT after completing 2 full-time trimesters at SFBU. The deadline to apply for CPT is Week 11 of the working period. e.g. if you are interested in taking CPT during the Summer 2023 trimester, the deadline to submit the application is Week 11 of Summer 2023.

You can submit the application on your student portal under My Requests -> Academic Requests -> CPT Application.

 

Start and End Dates
You may begin your CPT during the trimester break prior to the start of the trimester or at any time during the trimester’s first twelve (12) weeks. Your end date must be the last day of the trimester.

 

Continuing CPT
If you plan to continue with the same job, you will need to register for a new CPT course in the next trimester by completing a new request and following the process again. Apply early so there is no interruption.

 

Trimester Break
Students who are on a complete trimester break will have to pay a registration fee, learning resource fee, campus fee, and an insurance fee as well as the CPT course tuition fee.

 

Social Security Card
If you do not have a social security number (SSN), the CPT advisor will provide you with a letter in support of your SSN. This letter is issued by a Designated School Official (DSO) upon approval of your CPT. You will need to apply for an SSN at a local Social Security Administration office.

 

Optional Practical Training (OPT)
Please be aware that if you wish to take OPT after you graduate, you must not take more than 12 months of full-time CPT at your current academic level (undergraduate or graduate). There are no restrictions on OPT eligibility for part-time CPT.

Frequently Asked Questions
Do I qualify for CPT if I transferred from another institution in the United States?
Students who have studied at another institution for a period of time preceding him/her joining SFBU can have that period be counted towards their CPT eligibility. Simply ensure that you meet all the requirements. (Refer to Step 1)

What if I am currently working on changing my Visa status, such as H4 to F1?
You can apply for CPT upon receiving your F1 status. Simply ensure you meet all the requirements. (Refer to Step 1)

I am a U. S. Citizen (or legal permanent resident), can I take CPT?
Yes, you are eligible for CPT and are able to take CPT immediately.

What if my employers’ corporate office is outside of California?
Students must adhere to the 50 mile radius rule. However, if your employer has a local clientele office, you can work so long as their local address is specified in your job offer letter and in your CPT application.

How many times can I enroll in CPT?
No more than 6 units of practicum coursework may be counted towards graduation.

Will my reports be graded?
Reports will be graded on a Satisfactory (S)/No Pass (NP) basis. Reports that are incomplete or submitted late have the consequence of receiving a NP grade. If a student receives two NP grades, their CPT will be terminated and they will receive a failing grade in the course. Students who fail CPT will not receive future opportunities to participate in CPT again.

I am authorized for CPT, but what do I do if I change my mind, change my visa status or something about my job changes?
For any changes in your CPT, you must notify the CPT Advisor immediately. If you're an international student, the CPT Advisor may have to amend or cancel your CPT I-20.

"Big Data and Hadoop were just two of my favorite SFBU courses. My favorite project was the Bloom Filter in Big Data, taught by Dr. Henry Chang. It exposed me to how to perform content filtering while putting it on the AWS platform."
